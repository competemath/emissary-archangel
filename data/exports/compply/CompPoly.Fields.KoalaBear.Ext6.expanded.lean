# The degree-6 extension of KoalaBear

`KoalaBear[X] / (X^6 + X^3 + 1)`, a field of `p^6 ≈ 2^186` elements. The modulus is `Φ₉`, the
ninth cyclotomic polynomial, so the adjoined root `θ` is a primitive 9th root of unity.

As at degree 5, the modulus is necessarily *not* a binomial, and for a stronger reason: since
`p - 1 = 2^24 · 127` we have `3 ∤ p - 1`, so `x ↦ x^3` is a bijection on KoalaBear and every `W`
is a cube `V^3`, whence `X^6 - W = (X^2 - V)(X^4 + V X^2 + V^2)` factors for *every* `W`. So no
degree-6 binomial extension of KoalaBear exists at all.

`Φ₉` is chosen among the irreducible sextics because every entry of its reduction table
`X^6 … X^10 mod f` is `±1` — reduction costs no base-field multiplications — and the same holds
for its Frobenius matrix, since `p ≡ 2 mod 9` makes Frobenius `θ ↦ θ^2`. It also carries the
`2`-then-`3` tower implicitly: `θ^3` is a primitive cube root of unity generating the `F_p²`
subfield, because `Y^2 + Y + 1` is irreducible over KoalaBear.

Irreducibility of `X^6 + X^3 + 1` is `KoalaBear.sexticPoly_irreducible`
(`CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext6/SexticIrreducible.lean`), proved by Rabin's test at a degree with
two prime factors, with kernel-checked certificates for all three conditions. Supporting files
live under `KoalaBear/Ext6/`.

This sits alongside `KoalaBear.Ext5` rather than replacing it; the two are independent instances
of the same framework.

## Main definitions

* `KoalaBear.ext6Params`: the `ExtensionParams` for `X^6 + X^3 + 1`.
* `KoalaBear.Ext6`: the extension field itself.
