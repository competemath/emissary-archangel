# The Pasta (Pallas / Vesta) base prime fields

The Pallas and Vesta curves form a 2-cycle: the base field of one is the scalar field of the
other.  This module defines the two underlying 255-bit primes together with their Lucas/Pratt
primality certificates, following the pattern of `CompPoly.Fields.Secp256k1`.

* `Pallas.baseFieldSize` is the Pallas base field size, equal to the Vesta scalar field size;
* `Vesta.baseFieldSize` is the Vesta base field size, equal to the Pallas scalar field size.

Both primes are `1 mod 2 ^ 32` and have 2-adicity 32.  The certificates were generated from
the factorizations of `p - 1` and `q - 1`; see <https://github.com/zcash/pasta>.
