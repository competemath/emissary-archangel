# The degree-3 extension of `GF(2^64)`

```text
GF(2^64)[y] / (y^3 + y + 1),   giving GF(2^192)
```

An element is `c0 + c1 * y + c2 * y^2` with each coefficient in `BF64`. The carrier comes
from the computable extension framework in `CompPoly/Fields/Extension/`, so `Ext ext3Params`
is definitionally `Vector BF64 3` — the three-limb layout, with no translation needed.

Irreducibility needs no certificate here, unlike the degree-64 base modulus: a cubic is
irreducible exactly when it has no root, and a short characteristic-two argument rules one
out. See `CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext5.lean` for the general monic-modulus pattern this
follows.

## Main definitions

* `ext3Poly` — the modulus `y^3 + y + 1` over `BF64`.
* `ext3Params` — its `CompPoly.Extension.ExtensionParams`.
* `Ext3` — the extension field itself.

## Main statements

* `ext3Poly_irreducible` — the cubic is irreducible over `BF64`.
* `ext3Params_poly` — the coefficient vector `#v[1, 1, 0]` denotes that cubic.
* `card_ext3` — `Fintype.card Ext3 = 2 ^ 192`.

## Implementation notes

`ext3Params_poly` is load-bearing: it ties the coefficient vector `#v[1, 1, 0]` to
`y ^ 3 + y + 1`. A wrong vector there would still compile and would silently give a
different field, so it is checked against reference vectors in
`tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Binary/BF64.lean` rather than only re-derived.

/-! ## Irreducibility

A cubic is irreducible exactly when it has no root. A root `a` of `y^3 + y + 1` satisfies
`a^3 = a + 1`, from which `a^7 = 1`. The multiplicative group of `GF(2^64)` has order
`2^64 - 1`, which is coprime to `7`, so `a = 1` — and `1` is not a root.

A root has `a ^ 7 = 1`, so its multiplicative order divides `7`. It also divides
`Fintype.card BF64 - 1 = 2 ^ 64 - 1`, which is coprime to `7`, so the order is `1` and
