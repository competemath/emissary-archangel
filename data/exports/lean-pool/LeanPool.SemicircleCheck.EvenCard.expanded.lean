  EVEN CARDINALITY FROM A FIXED-POINT-FREE INVOLUTION

  A finite set closed under a fixed-point-free involution has even cardinality.
  This is the small combinatorial lemma later used in the Catalan recurrence.

/-- A finite set closed under a fixed-point-free involution has even cardinality.

Proof by strong induction: pick any `x ∈ S`, remove the pair `{x, p x}`,
show the remainder is still closed under `p`, and recurse. -/
