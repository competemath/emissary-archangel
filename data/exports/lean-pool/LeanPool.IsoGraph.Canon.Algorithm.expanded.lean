# Canonical labelling of finite graphs (a compact "mini-nauty")

This file is deliberately *programming* Lean rather than *proving* Lean: it implements an
individualisation–refinement (IR) canonical labelling algorithm in the style of McKay's `nauty`,
with no `Prop`-level content at all.  Correctness proofs live elsewhere; the only thing this file
promises syntactically is termination.

## The algorithm

Fix a graph `G` on the vertex set `{0, …, n-1}`.

* An **ordered partition** of the vertices is stored `nauty`-style: an array `lab` listing the
  vertices in partition order, its inverse `pos`, and for every *position* `i` the start `cst[i]`
  and end `cen[i]` of the cell containing position `i`.  Cells are contiguous blocks of `lab`.

* **Refinement** (`refine`) computes the coarsest equitable ordered partition refining a given
  one, by the usual Hopcroft-style worklist: pop a cell `S` (the *splitter*), and split every
  other cell `C` according to `|N(v) ∩ S|`, ordering the fragments by increasing count.  This is
  1-dimensional Weisfeiler–Leman; on a random graph it already produces a discrete partition.

* A discrete ordered partition *is* a labelling, so it yields a **certificate**: the adjacency
  matrix read off in that order, stored one `Nat` bitmask per row.  Certificates are totally
  ordered lexicographically.

* When refinement does not discretise, we **individualise**: pick the first non-singleton cell
  (an isomorphism-invariant choice), split off one of its vertices, re-refine, and recurse.  This
  produces a search tree whose leaves are labellings.

* The canonical labelling is the leaf that is largest for the order
  `(invariant path, certificate)`, lexicographically.  The **invariant path** records, for each
  node on the root-to-leaf path, a hash of the *trace* of the refinement that produced it (which
  cells split, into what sizes, at which counts) together with the shape of the resulting
  partition.  Everything hashed is a function of positions and multiplicities only — never of
  vertex names — so the invariant path is an isomorphism invariant.

Two prunings make this fast:

* **Invariant pruning.**  At a node of depth `d`, compare its length-`d` invariant path with that
  of the best leaf so far.  Smaller ⇒ every leaf below is smaller ⇒ prune.  Larger ⇒ every leaf
  below beats the incumbent ⇒ discard the incumbent.

* **Automorphism pruning.**  Two leaves with equal certificates differ by an automorphism `γ`,
  which we record.  At a node with individualisation path `p`, any recorded `γ` fixing `p`
  pointwise maps the subtree below `p ++ [v]` isomorphically onto the one below `p ++ [γ v]`, so
  only one vertex per orbit needs to be explored.

Note that hash collisions can only *weaken* pruning: an invariant path is used solely as the first
component of a total order on leaves, and any isomorphism-invariant function works there.
