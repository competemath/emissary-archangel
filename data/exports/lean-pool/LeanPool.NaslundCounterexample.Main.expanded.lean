# Counterexamples to Naslund's Conjecture 13

The conjecture is from Eric Naslund, *Paley graphs and Sárközy's theorem in function
fields*, Quarterly Journal of Mathematics 74 (2023), 627–637, Conjecture 13
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01293v3). This project refutes its square-difference case
over F_3; it does not assert a counterexample over other finite fields.

The upstream source was written by Claude under JD Jones's direction, with Claude,
GPT-6 and Grok consulted for the construction and proofs. Lean Pool adaptations
rename declarations, narrow imports and optimize proofs; the statements are unchanged.

The two polynomial families give the existence statements once their internal degree
bound is converted to the public one. The two refutations compare their sizes with the
conjectured bound `3^{3n/4}`: for `n = 8e` this is `3^{6e} = 729^e < 810^e`, and for `n = 8e + 4`
it is `3^{6e+3} = 27 · 729^e < 27 · 810^e`. The growth rate is the theorem of
`NaslundCounterexample.Asymptotics`.

The statements below are proved from the explicit polynomial families.
