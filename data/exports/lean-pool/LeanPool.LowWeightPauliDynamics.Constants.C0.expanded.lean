# The constant `c₀` and the time threshold `t₀`

The truncation-error theorem `apd:thm:one_step_truncation_error` holds for times below the
threshold `t₀ = 1 / (c₀ · Γ · (k_h − 1) · α)` (`apd:eq:time_condition`). The constant `c₀`
(`apd:eq:c0`) is what remains when the `(m*+1)`-th root is distributed over the summed truncation
bound `apd:eq:total_high_weight_norm`:

  `c₀ = (r+1)/r · exp[ (9/4)(m*+1)/(rΓ) ] · (1 + 4eβ)^{1/(m*+1)}`,

with `r` the number of Trotter steps, `Γ` the number of layers per step, `m*` the index of the
truncation weight `w* = k_o + m*(k_h−1)`, and `1 + 4eβ` the entry factor of `apd:eq:entry_bound`.
This file defines `c₀` as a function of four real parameters, `cZero r m G B` with `B` standing
for `4eβ`, proves `c₀ ≤ 2` under explicit hypotheses, and exhibits witnesses showing that the
hypotheses `1 ≤ m*` and `5 ≤ r` are needed.

## Main definitions

* `cZero r m G B`: the constant `c₀`.
* `tZero c G kh a`: the threshold `t₀ = 1/(c Γ (k_h − 1) α)`.
* `Admissible r m G`: the step-count conditions `r ≥ m*` and `r ≥ 8(m*+1)²/Γ`
  (`apd:eq:multijump_factor`), together with `1 ≤ r`, `0 ≤ m*` and `0 < Γ`.

## Main results

* `cZero_le_two_sharp`, `cZero_le_two`: if `Admissible r m G`, `1 ≤ m`, `5 ≤ r` and `0 ≤ B ≤ 1`,
  then `c₀ ≤ (384/275)·√2 ≈ 1.9748 ≤ 2`. `cZero_le_two_without_m_le_r` shows that the clauses
  `m ≤ r` and `0 < G` of `Admissible` are not needed for this.
* Alternative sufficient conditions, each with `Admissible r m G` and `0 ≤ B ≤ 1`:
  `cZero_le_two_of_gamma_le_six` (`1 ≤ m` and `Γ ≤ 6`, which forces `5 ≤ r` by
  `le_r_of_gamma_le_six`), `cZero_le_two_of_gamma_le_seven` (`1 ≤ m` and `Γ ≤ 7`), and
  `cZero_le_two_of_three_le_m` (`3 ≤ m`, with no further condition on `r` or `Γ`).
* Necessity witnesses, admissible points with `c₀ > 2`: `two_lt_cZero_of_admissible` at
  `(r, m*, Γ, B) = (1, 1, 32, 0)`, `two_lt_cZero_of_admissible_four` at `(4, 1, 8, 1)`,
  `two_lt_cZero_of_m_zero` at `(5, 0, 2, 1)` and `two_lt_cZero_of_m_two` at `(2, 2, 36, 1)`;
  moreover `two_lt_cZero_of_m_zero_general`: `c₀ > 2` at `m* = 0` for every `r > 0`, `Γ > 0` and
  `B ≥ 1`.
* Dependence on `Γ`: `cZero_antitone_gamma` (at fixed `r`) and `cZero_extremal_isotone_gamma`
  (along the boundary `rΓ = 8(m*+1)²` of the admissible set).
* Constants under weaker hypotheses: `cZero_le_four_mul_exp` (`c₀ ≤ 4e^{9/32}` on `Admissible`
  with `0 ≤ B ≤ 1`), attained by `cZero_eq_four_mul_exp_at_worst`, and
  `cZero_le_ten_thirds_of_one_le_m` (`c₀ ≤ 10/3` once `1 ≤ m`).
* `tZero_anti`: `t₀` is antitone in `c₀`.

## The role of each hypothesis

**`5 ≤ r`.** The smallest `r` allowed by `Admissible` is `max(1, m*, 8(m*+1)²/Γ)`, whose last
argument *shrinks* as `Γ` grows. At `m* ≤ 1` it can reach `1`; the factor `(r+1)/r` is then exactly
`2`, the exponential factor is strictly greater than `1` and the root factor is at least `1`, so
`c₀ > 2` for every `B ≥ 0`, including `B = 0`: the hypothesis concerns `r`, not the entry factor.
`two_lt_cZero_of_admissible` is the instance `(r, m*, Γ) = (1, 1, 32)`, and
`two_lt_cZero_of_admissible_four` shows that `4 ≤ r` is not enough. The layer count that enters is
the effective one, `ΥΓ`, which is `10Γ` for the fourth-order product formula (see the section on
the effective layer count below).

**`1 ≤ m`.** At `m* = 0` the root exponent `1/(m*+1)` is `1` rather than at most `1/2`, so the
third factor is the whole of `1 + B`: at `(r, m*, Γ, B) = (5, 0, 2, 1)` every other hypothesis of
`cZero_le_two` holds and `c₀ ≈ 3.006` (`two_lt_cZero_of_m_zero`). This is why `1 ≤ m` and `5 ≤ r`
are explicit arguments of `cZero_le_two` rather than fields of `Admissible`: the witnesses can then
be stated against `Admissible` itself.

**Larger `m*`.** The mechanism described under `5 ≤ r` needs `m* ≤ 1`. Since `Admissible` contains
`m ≤ r`, the smallest admissible `r` never falls below `m*`, so for `m* ≥ 2` no `Γ` drives
`(r+1)/r` to `2`: at `(r, m*, Γ, B) = (2, 2, 72, 1)`, where `Γ = 8(m*+1)²`, the smallest admissible
`r` is `2` and `c₀ ≈ 1.9806 < 2`. Two consequences, stated here as numerical observations (only the
named theorem is formalized). A *lower* bound on `Γ` can suffice once `m* ≥ 2`: at `m* = 2` and
`B ≤ 1`, every `Γ ≥ 59.60` gives `c₀ ≤ 2` for all admissible `r`. And the maximum of `c₀` over both
`Γ` and `r` drops below `2` from `m* = 3` on (it is `≈ 1.7011` at `m* = 3`), so `3 ≤ m` is a
sufficient condition constraining neither `r` nor `Γ` (`cZero_le_two_of_three_le_m`).

**`B ≤ 1`.** The remaining step-count condition of the theorem, `r ≥ 8e²w₂αt` with
`w₂ = k_o + k_h − 1`, constrains `αt` rather than the triple `(r, m*, Γ)` and so does not enter
`Admissible`. It is what bounds `B`: with `β = 2e·w₂·sin(dt)` and `sin(dt) ≤ αt/r` it gives
`β ≤ 1/(4e)`, that is `B ≤ 1`, which is the range assumed throughout this file.

The script `scripts/c0_scan.py` evaluates `c₀` in floating point on a parameter grid and at the
witness points above.

`cZero_le_two`, not a restatement of it: `(r, m*, Γ) = (5, 100, 20000)` satisfies every hypothesis

/-! ### A cap on the effective layer count

A second sufficient condition for `c₀ ≤ 2`, in which an upper bound on `Γ` takes the place of
`5 ≤ r`. It does **not** supersede `m* ≥ 1 ∧ r ≥ 5`: over the reals the two hypothesis sets are
*incomparable*, since `Γ ≤ 7` admits `r = 32/7 < 5`, and `r ≥ 5` admits `Γ = 32`.

`Γ` occurs in `cZero` exactly once, in the **denominator** of the exponent, so `c₀` is antitone in
`Γ` at fixed `r` (`cZero_antitone_gamma`). Large `Γ` is therefore not by itself what pushes `c₀`
above 2. What does is `r → 1`, which a large `Γ` *permits* through `Admissible`'s
`8(m*+1)² ≤ rΓ`. A cap on `Γ` works only by keeping that lower bound on `r` high, and
`le_r_of_gamma_le_six` makes the mechanism explicit.

**The quantity capped is the effective layer count.** For the `p`th-order product formula
(`apd:eq:suzuki`) one Trotter step consists of `ΥΓ` layers with `Υ = 2·5^{p/2−1}`
(`apd:thm:lightcone`), and `apd:thm:one_step_truncation_error` is applied with `Γ` replaced by
`ΥΓ`. The `G` argument below is that effective count, not the bare number of layers `Γ` of the
Hamiltonian: at bare `Γ = 7` the second-order formula already gives `G = 14`.

/-- **Along the admissible boundary, `c₀` is isotone in `Γ`**, in contrast to
`cZero_antitone_gamma` at fixed `r`; this is the direction relevant to a cap on `Γ`.

Both points below are admissible with `rΓ = 8(m*+1)² = 32` exactly, so both are *extremal* for their
cap, and the value **rises** with `Γ`:

  `c₀(32/6, 1, 6, 1) ≈ 1.9329  <  c₀(32/7, 1, 7, 1) ≈ 1.9838`.

The mechanism is `r`'s floor, not the exponential: `Admissible` forces `r ≥ 32/Γ`, so raising `Γ`
*lowers* the smallest admissible `r` and `(r+1)/r → 2`. At fixed `r` the exponential does fall —
that is `cZero_antitone_gamma` — so the two monotonicity statements have opposite signs and differ

The proof is exact rational arithmetic, which is the cleanest evidence that the exponential is not

Unlike `m* ≥ 1 ∧ r ≥ 5` and `m* ≥ 1 ∧ Γ_eff ≤ 7`, this condition constrains neither the number of
steps `r` nor the layer count `Γ`. Since `m* ∈ 𝒪(log(1/ε)/log(t₀/t))` grows with the accuracy
target, it holds in the high-accuracy regime in which the theorem is applied; it can fail for a
coarse accuracy target `ε`, which makes it a different kind of hypothesis from one that holds for

/-- **`m* ≥ 3` gives `c₀ ≤ 2`** on `Admissible r m G` with `0 ≤ B ≤ 1` — no further condition on
`r`, none on `Γ`.

Each factor is bounded separately from `m* ≥ 3`, which is why this needs none of the machinery the
`Γ` route did: `m ≤ r` gives `r ≥ 3` so `(r+1)/r ≤ 4/3`; `8(m*+1)² ≤ rΓ` caps the exponent at
`9/(32(m*+1)) ≤ 9/128`; and `m* + 1 ≥ 4` caps the root at `2^{1/4}`. The product is `1.7210`, a
**13.9%** margin — against 0.81% for `Γ ≤ 7`, so this is much the sturdiest of the three conditions.

**Cost in step count.** `Admissible`'s `8(m*+1)² ≤ rΓ` ties `m*` to `r`: raising `m*` to 3 raises
the step floor to `r ≥ 128/Γ`, which at `Γ_eff = 6` is `r ≥ 21.3`, about four times the floor of
the `r ≥ 5` route at the same `Γ`. The hypothesis itself constrains no Trotter parameter; through
`Admissible` its margin is paid for in step count.

**Three is the least sufficient integer, but not the threshold over ℝ.** `Admissible` quantifies
`m : ℝ`, and numerically the threshold is `m* = 2.14237…`, the root of
`(1+1/m)·e^{9/(32(m+1))}·2^{1/(m+1)} = 2`. So `m* ≥ 9/4` would also suffice (supremum `1.9494`);
these real thresholds are numerical observations and are not formalized. The integer `3` is stated
because `m*` is a rung index, an integer in the paper, not because the bound fails just below it.
`two_lt_cZero_of_m_two` shows `m* ≥ 2` does not suffice, so no integer smaller than 3 works. -/

/-! ### The unconditional constant, and the ladder between it and 2

On `Admissible` alone `c₀ ≤ 2` does not hold, but a larger constant does, with no further
hypothesis on `m*`, `r` or `Γ`. This section gives the sharp one and an intermediate rung, so the
trade is visible: every step down in the constant is a step up in what must be assumed, and
`t₀ = 1/(c₀Γ(k_h−1)α)` is antitone in `c₀` (`tZero_anti`), so a larger constant is a strictly
smaller guaranteed time window. The "sharp `c₀`" column is the supremum of `c₀` over `Admissible`
and `0 ≤ B ≤ 1` under the stated hypothesis, evaluated numerically; the last column names the
formalized statement, whose constant may be a rounder upper bound (`10/3`, `2`).

| hypothesis | sharp `c₀` | |
|---|---|---|
| none | `4e^{9/32} ≈ 5.2991` | `cZero_le_four_mul_exp` |
| `m* ≥ 1` | `2√2·e^{9/64} ≈ 3.2555` | `cZero_le_ten_thirds_of_one_le_m` (at `10/3`) |
| `m* ≥ 2` | `2.0756` | still above 2 — `two_lt_cZero_of_m_two` |
| `m* ≥ 3` | `1.7011` | `cZero_le_two_of_three_le_m` |

`m*` is not a property of the Hamiltonian: `w* = k_o + m*(k_h−1)`, so it is chosen by the user of
the algorithm.

**Where `c₀ ≤ 2` fails on `Admissible`.** The supremum exceeds 2 at `m* ∈ {0, 1, 2}` and is below
2 from `m* = 3` on; over the reals the threshold is `m* ≈ 2.142374`. Only `m* = 0` is degenerate:
there `w* = k_o`, so the truncation **retains nothing above the observable's own weight** (it still
computes the `≤ k_o` sector). `m* = 1` and `m* = 2` are ordinary settings, and the witness
`(1, 1, 32)` of `two_lt_cZero_of_admissible` sits at `m* = 1`.

So the *unconditional supremum* `5.2991` is attained only at the degenerate point `m* = 0`, and in
that sense its size is a boundary effect. **The failure of `c₀ ≤ 2` on `Admissible` alone is not**:
it occurs at ordinary values of `m*` as well.

In summary, `m* ≥ 3` is a hypothesis on the cutoff alone, and the unconditional constant needs no
hypothesis at a cost of `2.65×` in `t₀`.

/-- **The sharp unconditional bound: `c₀ ≤ 4e^{9/32} ≈ 5.2991`**, on `Admissible` and
`0 ≤ B ≤ 1` alone — no further condition on `m*`, `r` or `Γ`.

Each factor is bounded by its own extreme and **all three extremes are attained simultaneously**, at
`(r, m*, Γ, B) = (1, 0, 8, 1)`: `r ≥ 1` gives `(r+1)/r ≤ 2`; `m* ≥ 0` caps the exponent at
`9/(32(m*+1)) ≤ 9/32`; and `1/(m*+1) ≤ 1` caps the root at `1 + B ≤ 2`. So the crude
separate-factor argument loses nothing here, and `cZero_eq_four_mul_exp_at_worst` shows the value is
reached — this is a maximum, not an estimate.

Weakening `2` to this costs a factor `2.6495` in `t₀` (see `tZero_anti`), hence `2.6495^{m*+1}` in
the error bound `(t/t₀)^{m*+1}` at fixed `t`, and it shrinks `log(t₀/t)` — the denominator of
`w* = k_o + 𝒪(log(1/ε)/log(t₀/t))` — by `ln 2.6495 = 0.974`. -/

/-- **The intermediate rung: `c₀ ≤ 10/3` needs only `m* ≥ 1`** (on `Admissible r m G` with

`m* ≥ 1` is the mildest nontrivial hypothesis available — it says merely that the truncation
threshold exceeds the observable's own locality, i.e. that the truncation retains Pauli operators
above the observable's own weight. The supremum there is `2√2·e^{9/64} ≈ 3.2555`, at
`(r, m*, Γ, B) = (1, 1, 32, 1)`; `10/3` is the clean bound above it, proved from `exp_factor_le`
and `root_factor_le` with no new estimate.

Against the unconditional `5.2991` this recovers a factor `1.59` of `t₀`, for a hypothesis that
