# Generic relation lemmas for the boundedness corollaries (issue #12, step 6 layer 1)

Pure order-theoretic consequences of the raw positive conclusion `RelPreserving`, with no
model extraction involved:

* `RelPreserving.injective_of_irreflexive` — the derived injectivity corollary (issue
  precision note: injectivity is **not** part of the raw theorem, it is a corollary under
  irreflexivity of the interpreted relation);
* `RelPreserving.descending` — the negative rationals give an infinite strictly descending
  sequence through the interpreted relation;
* `not_relPreserving_of_wellFounded` — hence no relation-preserving map from `ℚ` exists into
  a structure whose interpreted relation is well-founded (via `WellFounded.has_min`; no
  strict-order hypotheses, so `RelEmbedding.natGT` is deliberately not used).
