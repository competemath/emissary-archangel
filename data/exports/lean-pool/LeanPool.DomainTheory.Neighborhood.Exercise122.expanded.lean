# Exercise 1.22 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, §1) — the topology on `|𝒟|`

> **EXERCISE 1.22.** (For topologists). Show that the neighbourhoods `[X]` for `X
∈ 𝒟` make
> `|𝒟|` into a topological space where the open subsets `𝒰 ⊆ |𝒟|` can be
characterized by the
> following two conditions:
>
> (i)  whenever `x ∈ 𝒰` and `x ⊑ y ∈ |𝒟|`, then `y ∈ 𝒰`; and
> (ii) whenever `x ∈ 𝒰`, then `[X] ⊆ 𝒰` for some `X ∈ x`.
>
> Prove also that the inclusion relation on `|𝒟|` can be defined topologically as:
>
> (iii) `x ⊑ y` iff for all open `𝒰 ⊆ |𝒟|`, if `x ∈ 𝒰` then `y ∈ 𝒰`.

Here `[X] = {x ∈ |𝒟| ∣ X ∈ x}` (Scott's notation from Theorem 1.10): the set of
elements
(filters) of which `X` is a member. We call it `basicOpen X`.

## What is proved

* `basicOpen` — Scott's `[X]`, with `mem_basicOpen` the membership unfolding.
* `instTopologicalSpaceElement` — the topology on `V.Element`: `𝒰` is open iff
every point of
  `𝒰` has a basic neighbourhood `[X]` (`X ∈ x`) contained in `𝒰`. This is
  condition (ii); the
  three topology axioms are verified directly (the basic opens are closed under
  finite `∩`, with
  `[Δ] = |𝒟|` the whole space, so they form a base).
* `isOpen_basicOpen` — each `[X]` is open.
* `isOpen_iff_upper_basic` — the characterization: `IsOpen 𝒰 ↔ (i) ∧ (ii)`. Note
(ii) already
  pins down openness; (i) (upward closure under `⊑`) is a *consequence* of (ii),
  recorded
  separately as `isOpen_isUpperSet`. We keep both to match Scott's statement.
* `le_iff_isOpen_imp` — condition (iii): `x ⊑ y ↔ ∀ 𝒰 open, x ∈ 𝒰 → y ∈ 𝒰`. This
says `⊑` is
  the (opposite of the) specialization preorder; `specializes_iff_le` makes the
  bridge to
  Mathlib's `⤳` explicit.

The space is **T₀** but not in general **T₁**/Hausdorff (the specialization order
`⊑` is a genuine
partial order, recoverable from the topology by (iii)); the open-ended limit-point
questions of the
exercise need Definition 1.7 (`↑X`) and are deferred.
