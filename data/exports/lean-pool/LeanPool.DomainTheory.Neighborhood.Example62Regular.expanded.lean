# Example 6.2 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, §6) — eventually-periodic trees and regular
events

Following Dana Scott, *Lectures on a Mathematical Theory of Computation*, PRG-19
(1981), Lecture VI,
*Introduction to domain equations*. After exhibiting the generalised domain
equation `A ≅ Aⁿ + Aⁿ`
(formalised in `Example62A.lean`), Scott closes Example 6.2 with a *casual aside*
connecting his
infinite `±`-labelled `n`-ary trees to automata theory:

> "We say that a (total) tree `a` is *eventually periodic* iff the set `{aσ ∣ σ ∈
Σ*}` is finite.
> The result is that the 'language' `L_a = {σ ∈ Σ* ∣ pos(aσ) = true}`
corresponding to an eventually
> periodic tree is always a *regular event* of automata theory, and every such
language has this form.
> In fact, `a` just represents the initial state of an automaton, and `aσ`
represents the state after
> 'reading' a tape `σ`."

This file makes that remark precise and *proves* it. Scott's total trees over `Σ =
{0, …, n-1}` are
exactly the functions `a : Σ* → Bool` assigning a `±` label (`pos`) to every node,
addressed by a
finite selector `σ ∈ Σ*`. The **subtree** operation `σ ↦ aσ` is Scott's selector
recursion
`aΛ = a`, `a(iσ) = (aᵢ)σ`; its *language* `L_a` is the set of selectors landing on
a `+` node.

The two halves of Scott's claim are exactly the two halves of the **Myhill–Nerode
theorem**: a tree
is eventually periodic (finitely many distinct subtrees) iff its language has
finitely many *left
quotients* iff (Myhill–Nerode, `Language.isRegular_iff_finite_range_leftQuotient`)
the language is
regular. The bridge is that the subtree `aσ` *is* the left quotient `σ⁻¹ L_a`:
reading the tape `σ`
moves the automaton to the residual language, which is precisely the subtree at
`σ`.

This is a `Prop`-level result (about regularity), so `Classical.choice` is
unobjectionable here; the
content is entirely the combinatorics-on-words / automata correspondence,
orthogonal to the
neighbourhood-system machinery.
