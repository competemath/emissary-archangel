# Witnesses for the chain configurations

The four-point catalogue is not vacuous: `rhombus_chain_config` and
`centroid_chain_config` exhibit the two planar patterns of the chain-quadruple theorem — the
rhombus made of two equilateral triangles glued along an edge (five short edges and one long
one) and the equilateral triangle together with its centroid (three short edges and three long
ones).  Both have all six squared distances inside the adjacent pair `{1, 3}`.
