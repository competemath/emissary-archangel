# Lecture VI — Proposition 6.6 (Scott 1981, PRG-19): initial algebras are uniquely
isomorphic

**Proposition 6.6.** Any two initial `T`-algebras are uniquely isomorphic.

The proof is the standard diagram chase. If `A` and `B` are both initial,
initiality gives unique
homomorphisms `f : A → B` and `g : B → A`. Their composites `g ∘ f : A → A` and `f
∘ g : B → B` are
homomorphisms, and by uniqueness of homomorphisms out of an initial algebra they
must equal the
identity homomorphisms. Hence the underlying morphisms of `f` and `g` are mutually
inverse, giving an
isomorphism `A.carrier ≅ B.carrier`. The isomorphism is *unique* in that the
homomorphism `A → B`
realising it is the only one (`iso_hom_unique`).

Choice-free (`#print axioms ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound}`).
