# Exercise 5.16 follow-up (Scott 1981, PRG-19, Lecture V) — overlap-freeness of
`t`

The second Thue–Morse property Scott asks for: `t` is **overlap-free**, `t ≠
u·a·a·a·v` for any
finite `u` and nonempty `a`. This is a self-contained theorem of combinatorics on
words (Thue 1912);
it uses **no domain theory** (only the parity recurrences `tm (2n) = tm n`, `tm
(2n+1) = ¬ tm n` of
the bit-function `tm` from `Exercise516ThueMorse`) and has no leverage from
Mathlib, so it is proved
from scratch here.

We phrase an **overlap** of period `p ≥ 1` at offset `i` as a factor of length
`2p+1` with period
`p`: `Overlap i p := 1 ≤ p ∧ ∀ k ≤ p, tm (i+k) = tm (i+p+k)`. The main theorem
`no_overlap` shows no
overlap exists, and `overlap_free` is Scott's literal cube form `t ≠ u·a·a·a·v`
(an overlap is
weaker than a cube, so the cube form follows).

The proof is the classical descent: the two base facts are *no three consecutive
equal symbols*
(`no_three_consec`, the period-1 case) and a direct period-3 computation; an even
period `2q`
contracts to a period-`q` overlap via the substitution structure, and an odd
period `≥ 5` forces a
run of three equal symbols.
