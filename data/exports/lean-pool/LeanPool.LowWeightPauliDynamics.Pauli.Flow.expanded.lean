# The damped local norm flow, and the Pauli inhabitant of `Ladder`

This file proves `apd:thm:local_flow_k_local`, the damped local norm flow on which the
quantitative truncation-error analysis of LPD rests:

  `N_{≥m}^{(g)} ≤ N_{≥m}^{(g-1)} + sin(dt)·N_{≥m-1}^{(g-1)}`.

Here `N_{≥m}^{(g)}` is the high-weight norm (`apd:eq:def_high_weight_norm`) of the observable
after `g` Pauli rotations, taken above the rung weight `w_m = k_o + (m-1)(k_h-1)`. The file then
uses the inequality to construct an instance of the abstract structure `Lean4LPD.Ladder`, whose
`step` field is exactly this recursion. The consequences of the recursion are proved in `Ladder/`
for an abstract ladder, with no Pauli infrastructure, so the instance is what makes them apply to
the Pauli model.

## Main definitions

* `PauliString.partner`, `PauliString.partnerSign`: the pairing `s ↔ ±i G s` of the classes that
  anticommute with `G`, and the sign relating `i G s` to the self-adjoint representative `herm`.
* `PauliString.rotAct`: the action of conjugation by one Pauli rotation on coefficient vectors.
* `PauliString.traj`: the Heisenberg trajectory `O^{(g)} = U_g† O U_g`.
* `PauliString.ladderN`: the family `N m g` of high-weight norms along the trajectory.
* `PauliString.pauliLadder`, `PauliString.pauliWeightedLadder`, `PauliString.pauliLadderOfHerm`:
  the instances of `Ladder` and `WeightedLadder`.

## Main results

* `PauliString.coeffVec_conj`: conjugation by one rotation acts on coefficient vectors as
  `rotAct`.
* `PauliString.norm_rotAct`: `rotAct` is an isometry of `ℓ²`.
* `PauliString.norm_restr_high_rotAct_low`: the inflow into the high-weight region is at most
  `|sin θ|` times the mass on the partners.
* `PauliString.highNorm_conj_le_highNorm`, `PauliString.local_flow_k_local`:
  `apd:thm:local_flow_k_local` for one rotation, at general thresholds and at the rung weights.
* `PauliString.highNorm_conj_le_pauliNorm`: the form used at rung `1`, with the total mass on the
  right.
* `PauliString.pauliNorm_conj`, `PauliString.pauliNorm_traj`: unitary invariance of the Pauli
  2-norm.
* `PauliString.highNorm_restr_le`: restriction (truncation) only decreases high-weight norms.

The one-rotation theorems assume only that the generator is a Hermitian Pauli string of weight at
most `k_h`; they hold for every operator `O` and every angle. In particular no locality hypothesis
on the observable is needed, which is stronger than the paper's statement. Locality of the initial
observable enters only through the `init` field of `pauliLadder`.

## The argument

The proof follows the paper's, in four moves.

1. **The coefficient vector** — `Pauli/Coeff.lean`, with `‖O‖_{2,normalized} = ‖x‖_{ℓ²}`.
2. **Conjugation acts as a real orthogonal matrix `A`**: commuting classes are fixed,
   anticommuting ones pair up as `s ↔ ±i G s`, and `A` is a planar rotation on each pair. Here
   that is `rotAct`, and it is a *theorem* about the coefficients (`coeffVec_conj`) rather than a
   description: `Pauli/Branch.lean`'s `pauli_rotation_branch_anticommute_hermitian` supplies the
   operator identity (`apd:eq:pauli_rotation_branch`), trace cyclicity moves the conjugation onto
   the Pauli, and `partnerSign` is the sign of `±i G s`, which becomes part of the matrix entry.
   Orthogonality is `norm_rotAct`.
3. **`‖A_RR‖ ≤ 1`**: a submatrix of an orthogonal matrix has operator norm at most one.
   `BlockNorm.lean` proves exactly that statement, but it is not what is used here: no matrix `A`
   is ever built, so the corresponding step is
   `‖restr R (rotAct G θ v)‖ ≤ ‖rotAct G θ v‖ = ‖v‖`, i.e. `norm_restr_le` composed with the
   isometry. Same content, one fewer object.
4. **The inflow `‖A_RB x_B‖ ≤ sin(dt)·N_{≥m-1}`** — `norm_restr_high_rotAct_low`.
   The weight step is `weight_le_weight_mul_add_kh`, whose `k_h − 1` (rather than `k_h`) holds only
   because the pairing is between *anticommuting* Paulis; see `Pauli/Weight.lean`.

Minkowski's inequality is `norm_add_le` on `EuclideanSpace`.

## What is proved, and what is assumed

`local_flow_k_local` is the inequality for one rotation at rung `m ≥ 2`, in the variables
`w_m = k_o + (m-1)(k_h-1)`. `pauliLadder` is the `Ladder` instance, hence the inequality along a
whole trajectory, at every rung, and `pauliWeightedLadder` is the same family as a
`WeightedLadder`. **`MultiLadder` is not inhabited here**: its `step` is the multi-jump recursion
of `apd:thm:layer_inflow`, about a layer of disjointly supported rotations; that instance is
`pauliMultiLadder` in `Pauli/LayerLadder.lean`.

Three things to read narrowly.

* **`a` is `|sin(dt)|`, not `sin(dt)`.** `pauliLadder` takes any `a` dominating every
  `|sin(θ_g)|`, which is what the estimate gives with no sign hypothesis on the angles.
* **Rung `0` is the reservoir, not `rungWeight ko kh 0`.** `Ladder/Defs.lean` explains why:
  truncated `ℕ` subtraction makes `rungWeight ko kh 0 = k_o`, whereas the model wants
  `w_0 = k_o - (k_h-1)`. So `ladderN` sets `N 0 g := ‖O^{(g)}‖_{2,normalized}`, which satisfies
  `reservoir`
  with equality by unitary invariance (`pauliNorm_traj`; this is the base case of
  `apd:cor:norm_cumulation_jump`). `step` at `m = 1` is then `highNorm_conj_le_pauliNorm`, which
  bounds the inflow by the total mass. Since the total mass dominates every high-weight norm
  (`highNorm_le_pauliNorm`), this reading makes `step` at `m = 1` *weaker* than the flow bound
  with a genuine weight threshold `w_0` on the right, and unlike that bound it needs no condition
  relating `k_o` and `k_h`.
* **The trajectory here carries no truncation.** Truncation zeroes coefficients and so only
  decreases every `N_{≥m}`, which is why `apd:cor:norm_cumulation_jump` holds along the truncated
  LPD trajectory as well. `highNorm_restr_le` is that statement on the coefficient side, but
  `traj` itself is the untruncated `U_g† O U_g`; the truncated trajectory and its ladder are in
  `Pauli/Truncate.lean`.

The flow is stated with the closed-form rotation `rot` and the entrywise Pauli matrices
`toMatrix`. That `rot` is the matrix exponential and that `toMatrix` is the correctly phased tensor
product are proved separately, in `RotationExp.lean` and `Pauli/Tensor.lean`.

The coefficient vector in the paper's proof is real. That is not formalized as a property of the
scalars: `coeff O p : ℂ`. It is not needed — the transformation is by real planar rotations, and
`∑ |x_p|²` is preserved for the same reason `∑ x_p²` would be. What *is* used is that the partner
`i G s` is a **Hermitian** Pauli (`isSelfAdjoint_phaseMul_one_mul`), which is what makes the
coefficient `sin θ` on it real.

In the proof of `apd:thm:local_flow_k_local` the Paulis that anticommute with the generator `G`
are grouped into unordered pairs `{s, s'}`, where `s' = ±i G s` is the partner of `s`, determined
up to sign. On classes that pairing is the translation `p ↦ (G.x + p.x, G.z + p.z)`, and it is an
