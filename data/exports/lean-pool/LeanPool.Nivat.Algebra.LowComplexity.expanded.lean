# An annihilator from low pattern complexity

The finite-range form of Lemma 3.2 (`lem:ann-exists`) is proved by affine
dependence among the occurring patterns. `exists_affine_annihilator` gives a nonzero filter
with constant output, and `exists_nonzero_annihilator` multiplies it by a nonzero difference.

The `windowPolynomial` linear map identifies finite coefficient vectors with
Laurent polynomials supported in the window. Its injectivity, support, action,
and reconstruction lemmas also supply the finite-dimensional pairing used in
Theorem 2.2 (`thm:descent`).
