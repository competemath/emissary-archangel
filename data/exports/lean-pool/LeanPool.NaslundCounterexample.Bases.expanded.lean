# The two bases

The recursion needs a starting set at each residue of `n` modulo `8` that the construction
reaches. `B_0 = {0}` is the trivial square-difference-free subset of `P_{3,0}`, and

`B_4 = { a T^3 + b T + c (1 - T^2) : a, b, c ∈ F_3 }`

is a square-difference-free subset of `P_{3,4}` with `27` elements. Square-difference-freeness of
`B_4` is the only place where the shape `1 - T^2` matters: a difference of two of its elements
has constant term `c` and `T^2`-coefficient `-c`, while a nonzero square of degree below `4` is
the square of a linear polynomial `v + u T`, with constant term `v^2` and `T^2`-coefficient
`u^2`; so `v^2 + u^2 = 0`, which in `F_3` forces `u = v = 0`.
