# Pauli weight, and the `k_h - 1` bound on how far a rotation can move it

This file defines the support and the weight of a Pauli string (`def:pauli_weight`) and proves the
weight estimate the damped ladder is built on: if a Pauli string `G` anticommutes with `s`, then
the product `G s` satisfies `| |G s| - |s| | ≤ |G| - 1`, hence `≤ k_h - 1` for a `k_h`-local `G`.

## Main definitions

* `PauliString.site`: the single-qubit Pauli type carried at a site, as a pair of bits.
* `PauliString.support`, `PauliString.weight`: the qubits on which a string acts non-trivially,
  and their number (`def:pauli_weight`).
* `PauliString.cancelSites`, `PauliString.antiSites`, `PauliString.createSites`: the three kinds
  of site of `supp G`, relative to a second string `s`.

## Main results

* `PauliString.card_cancelSites_add_card_antiSites_add_card_createSites`,
  `PauliString.weight_mul_add_card_cancelSites`: the exact site bookkeeping.
* `PauliString.sympForm_eq_card_antiSites`: the symplectic form is `#antiSites` modulo two.
* `PauliString.weight_mul_le`, `PauliString.weight_le_weight_mul_add_weight`: the bounds with the
  full weight `|G|`, which need no hypothesis.
* `PauliString.abs_weight_mul_sub_weight_le`: the two-sided bound with `|G| - 1` for an
  anticommuting pair.
* `PauliString.weight_sub_le_weight_mul`, `PauliString.weight_le_weight_mul_add_kh`,
  `PauliString.weight_mul_le_weight_add_kh`: the `k_h` forms the ladder consumes.
* `PauliString.exists_commuting_weight_increase_by_full_weight`: the anticommutation hypothesis
  cannot be dropped.

## The estimate, and why it is `k_h - 1` rather than `k_h`

The proof of `apd:thm:local_flow_k_local` needs: when `G` anticommutes with `s`, the partner Pauli
`G s` satisfies

  `|G s| ≥ |s| - (k_h - 1)`   for   `|G| ≤ k_h`,

which places the partner one rung down rather than `k_h` rungs down, and so supports the rung
spacing `w_m = k_o + (m-1)(k_h-1)`. In the other direction, `|G s| ≤ |s| + (k_h - 1)` is the
one-step bound behind reading `w_m` as the largest weight reachable from weight `k_o` by `m-1`
anticommuting `k_h`-local rotations. The recursion needs only these inequalities; that the weight
`w_m` is actually attained is not formalized. The two-sided statement, that the weight changes by
at most `k - 1` when `G` has weight at most `k`, is one of the consequences of
`apd:eq:pauli_rotation_branch` on which the paper's analysis rests.

The arithmetic is exact rather than estimated. Split the support of `G` by what it does to `s`:

* `cancelSites G s` — `G` and `s` carry the *same* non-identity Pauli, so the site drops out;
* `antiSites G s` — both non-identity and *different*, so the site survives in `G s`;
* `createSites G s` — `G` acts where `s` does not, so the site is new.

These three partition `supp G` (`card_cancelSites_add_card_antiSites_add_card_createSites`), and
separately `|G s| + #cancel = |s| + #create` (`weight_mul_add_card_cancelSites`). So the weight
moves by `#create - #cancel`, and each of those is at most `|G| - #anti`.

The whole of the `-1` is then one observation: `sympForm` counts `antiSites` mod 2
(`sympForm_eq_card_antiSites`), so anticommuting forces `#anti` **odd**, hence non-zero. A pair
that merely *commutes* gets `#anti` even, which may be `0`, and then only the weaker `|G|` is
available — which is why the bound is a statement about the anticommuting branch and not a
general fact about Pauli products.

## Naming

`weight` is `def:pauli_weight`'s `|P|`. `k_h` appears in the corollaries as a variable `kh : ℕ`,
implicit and inferred from the hypothesis `weight G ≤ kh`, so the statements read as they do in
the paper. Bounds of the form `|s| - (k_h - 1) ≤ …` use natural-number subtraction; this is
harmless, because the additive forms (`weight_le_weight_mul_add`, `weight_le_weight_mul_add_kh`)
are proved first and the subtractive ones are derived from them.
