# A nonzero discarded coefficient of weight above `w* k_h^Γ` in a second-order step

`Pauli/LayerWitness.lean` shows that on an 8-qubit brickwork with `k_h = 2`, `Γ = 2` and the
weight-one input `Z₃` (so `w* = 1`), the Pauli string `P₆` of weight `6` is *reachable* under the
four layers `L₁, L₂, L₂, L₁` of a second-order product-formula step (`apd:eq:suzuki`).
Reachability ignores the rotation angles, so by itself it does not show that `P₆` occurs in the
conjugated operator. This file supplies that step. It computes the coefficient of `P₆` after the
literal four-layer word in closed form,

  `coeff (pf2Output θ) (cls P₆) = -(sin θ)^3 (sin 2θ)^2`,

which is nonzero for `0 < θ < π/2`, and shows that the same coefficient survives in the operator
discarded by the truncation at `w* = 1`, the component `Õ^{(d)}_{≥w*+1}` of
`apd:eq:step_component`. Hence
the exponent `ΥΓ` in the weight bound `w* k_h^{ΥΓ}` on the discarded component
(`apd:thm:lightcone`) cannot be replaced by `Γ`: here `w* k_h^Γ = 4 < 6`.

## Main definitions

* `pf2Rotations θ`: the rotation word `L₁ ++ L₂ ++ L₂ ++ L₁`, every rotation with the same
  conjugation angle `θ`.
* `pf2Output θ`: the matrix obtained by conjugating `Z₃` with that word (`layerConj`).
* `pf2Discard θ`: what the truncation at weight `1` removes from `pf2Output θ`.

## Main results

* `pf2_coeff_polynomial`, `pf2_coeff_sines`: the coefficient of `pf2Output θ` at `cls P₆` is
  `-4 (cos θ)^2 (sin θ)^5 = -(sin θ)^3 (sin 2θ)^2`.
* `pf2_named_P6_component`: the corresponding operator component is
  `((sin θ)^3 (sin 2θ)^2) • P₆`. The sign changes because the canonical representative is
  `herm (cls P₆) = phaseMul 2 P₆` (`herm_P6_sign`), whose matrix is `-P₆`.
* `pf2Output_eq_four_layers`: `pf2Output θ` is the nested conjugation by the four layers.
* `pf2_coeff_ne_zero`: the coefficient is nonzero whenever `0 < θ` and `2 * θ < π`.
* `pf2Discard_coeff`, `actual_discard_exceeds_gamma_bound`: the discarded operator has a nonzero
  coefficient at a Pauli class of weight greater than `w* k_h^Γ = 4`.

## Method

`coeffVec_layerConj` turns the matrix conjugation into the coefficient action `layerAct`, and
`rotAct_apply` gives a two-term recurrence for one rotation. The recurrence is unfolded backwards
from the target class through the fourteen rotations of the word. Only 23 coefficient nodes are
expanded; every other branch the recurrence meets is shown to vanish by the sound support test
`backwardReaches` (`coeff_zero_of_not_backward`), and every sign is computed exactly from
`partnerSign`. Nothing is evaluated numerically.
