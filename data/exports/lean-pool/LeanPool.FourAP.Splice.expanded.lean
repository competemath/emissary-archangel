# The contradiction at the heart of Lemma 2

The last half of the extension lemma needs only three facts about the new
completion: the old prefix remains fixed, each parity restriction is 4AP-free,
and the odd-before-even comparison in equation (2) holds. We isolate this
argument so that the subsequent recursive construction can be read separately
from its safety proof.
