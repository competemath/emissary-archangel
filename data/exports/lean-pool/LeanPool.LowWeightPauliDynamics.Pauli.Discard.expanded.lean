# The operator discarded by a Pauli truncation

The component `Õ^{(d)}_{≥w*+1}` of `apd:eq:step_component` is an operator difference, `(1 - Π_{≤
w*}) A`,
where `A` is the evolved observable immediately before the truncation that ends step `d`. The
scalar `highNorm w A` measures the high-weight coefficients of `A`, but that definition alone
does not identify it with the norm of the discarded operator. This file proves the
identification.

`sub_truncOp` proves the general operator identity `A - Π_S A = Π_{Sᶜ} A`, using completeness of
the Pauli expansion. `pauliNorm_sub_truncOp_highSet_compl` then identifies the norm of the
operator discarded by a weight cut with `highNorm`. This is the norm identification in the last
equality of `apd:thm:triangle`, not that proposition's telescoping or expectation bound. No
trajectory, truncation schedule, or entanglement hypothesis enters here; trajectories and
schedules are in `Pauli/TrotterTruncate`, and the telescoping bound is in
`Pauli/TruncationError`.

All identities hold for arbitrary complex matrices indexed by bit strings, with Pauli strings
represented by the entrywise model `toMatrix`.

## Main results

* `coeff_ext`: an operator is determined by its Pauli coefficients.
* `sub_truncOp`, `sub_truncOp_compl`: `O - Π_S O = Π_{Sᶜ} O` and `O - Π_{Sᶜ} O = Π_S O`.
* `pauliNorm_truncOp`: the Pauli norm of `Π_S O` is the norm of the coefficient vector of `O`
  restricted to `S`.
* `pauliNorm_sub_truncOp_highSet_compl`: the operator discarded by a cut at weight `w` has Pauli
  norm `highNorm w O`.
