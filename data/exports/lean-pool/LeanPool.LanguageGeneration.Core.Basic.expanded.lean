# Language generation in the limit: basic definitions

This file fixes a countable universe `ℕ` and an indexed family of languages.
The family is indexed, rather than represented as a set of sets, because the
Kleinberg--Mullainathan algorithm depends on the enumeration order and permits
repeated languages.
