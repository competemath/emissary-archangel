# The multi-jump ladder and its first-passage majorant

This file defines the abstract multi-jump ladder `MultiLadder`, in which one layer may raise the
mass by several rungs at once, and proves for it the first-passage majorant
`apd:eq:composition_majorant` of `apd:rmk:multijump` (`MultiLadder.le_majorant`), together with
the monotonicity of the majorant in the number of layers.

The rotations of one layer have pairwise disjoint supports, so several of them can anticommute
with the same Pauli string. When `j ≥ 2` of them do, the string moves up `j` rungs within that
single layer. By `apd:thm:layer_inflow` the corresponding block of the layer's action is
bounded in norm by `ε_j^{(m)} := (w_{m+j} sin dt)^j / j!`. The power of `sin(dt)` is `j`, as for `j`
successive one-rung moves. The difference lies in the number of layers consumed, one
instead of `j`, and in the rung the jump starts from, which is `m - j` instead of `m - 1`.

The contribution of multi-jumps therefore has to enter the recursion as **additional inflow
terms**. It cannot be expressed as a constant factor in front of `apd:eq:layer_cumulation`,
because that bound is proportional to `C(T,m)` and hence zero whenever `T < m`, while mass can
cross the truncation threshold after a single layer. `apd:rmk:multijump` illustrates this with
`O = Z₁Z₂Z₃`, the layer `{X₁X₄, X₂X₅, X₃X₆}` and `w* = 5`: after one layer the evolved observable
contains a Pauli string of weight 6, reached by three simultaneous jumps, with coefficient
`sin³(dt)`. The bound that accounts for these inflows is the first-passage majorant
`apd:eq:composition_majorant`, formalized here.

## What the hypothesis says, and what it already assumes

In `apd:rmk:multijump` the recursion reads

  `N_m^{(T)} ≤ N_m^{(T-1)} + ∑_{j≥1} ε_j^{(m)} N_{m-j}^{(T-1)}`,   with `N_ν := ‖O‖` for `ν ≤ 0`.

Substituting the convention `N_ν := ‖O‖` splits the sum at `j = m`:

  `∑_{j≥1} ε_j^{(m)} N_{m-j}  =  ∑_{j=1}^{m-1} ε_j^{(m)} N_{m-j}  +  (∑_{j≥m} ε_j^{(m)}) · M`,

and the second bracket is the **entry factor** `E_m := ∑_{j≥m} ε_j^{(m)}`. It collects every way
of leaving the reservoir in one jump and landing above rung `m`, including the *overshoot* jumps
`j > m`, which start below rung 1 and which a plain sum over compositions of `m` would omit.
`MultiLadder.step` is that already-substituted form. Two consequences:

* the infinite sum does **not** appear here. `E` is an abstract field, related to `ε` by nothing
  at all, so the theorem below reads "if the recursion holds with *some* `E`, the majorant holds
  with that same `E`" — more general than the paper's statement. The series `∑_{j≥m}` appears
  exactly once in this development, as `Lean4LPD.entryFactor` in
  `Lean4LPD/Constants/Entry.lean`, where it is bounded (`apd:eq:entry_bound`);
* `N_ν = M` for `ν ≤ 0` is the reservoir bound, justified by unitary invariance of the 2-norm
  together with truncation only decreasing every `N`. Here it is part of the hypothesis `step`
  (the term `E m * M`), and it is discharged by the Pauli model in
  `Lean4LPD/Pauli/LayerLadder.lean` (`PauliString.pauliMultiLadder`), just as `Ladder.reservoir`
  is for the single-jump ladder.

## The recursive form of the chain sum

The majorant sums over strictly increasing rung sequences `0 < ν₁ < ⋯ < ν_k = m`. Peeling the
*last* jump gives the recursion that `chain` is **defined** by. `chain_diag` below then proves
the statement of `apd:rmk:multijump` that the all-ones term reproduces the layer-cumulation
bound, which is the check that the definition is the intended object rather than merely a
plausible one.

## Main definitions

* `chain ε E k m`: the total weight of the first-passage paths to rung `m` with exactly `k` jumps.
* `MultiLadder ε E M`: the damped ladder with every jump length retained.
* `MultiLadder.majorant`: the bound of `apd:eq:composition_majorant`, as a function of `m`, `T`.
* `MultiLadder.trivialMultiLadder`: the zero family, showing that the structure is inhabited.

## Main results

* `chain_eq_zero_of_lt`: a path to rung `m` uses at most `m` jumps.
* `chain_diag`: the all-ones term is `E 1 · ∏_{i=2}^{m} ε_1^{(i)}`.
* `MultiLadder.le_majorant`: the first-passage majorant, `N m T ≤ majorant ε E M m T`.
* `MultiLadder.majorant_mono`: the majorant is monotone in the number of layers.

`MultiLadder eps E M` is inhabited whenever `eps`, `E` and `M` are nonnegative, so the theorems
above are not statements about an empty type.

The witness below is the trivial one, `N ≡ 0`: it shows only that the field constraints are
jointly satisfiable. It is **not** evidence that `le_majorant` is tight. For tightness, note
that `sum_chain_succ` and `sum_chain_shift` combine to show that the majorant itself obeys the
recursion of `step` with equality; that saturating family is not packaged as a `MultiLadder`
here, and `Lean4LPD.satLadder` is the corresponding packaged statement on the single-jump side.
