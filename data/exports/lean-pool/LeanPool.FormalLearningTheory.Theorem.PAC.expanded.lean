# PAC Learning Theorems

VC characterization, fundamental theorem (5-way equivalence),
Sauer-Shelah, NFL, Occam's algorithm, PAC lower bound.

## Key dependencies (K₁-K₃ from Mathlib)

- K₁: Finset.vcDim + card_le_card_shatterer + card_shatterer_le_sum_vcDim (Sauer-Shelah)
- K₂: lean-rademacher (Rademacher complexity bounds) — external, future import
- K₃: Measure.pi (IsProbabilityMeasure instance for product measures)
- K₄: measure_sum_ge_le_of_iIndepFun (Hoeffding's inequality)

## Break Point BP₅: Five Generalization Bounds
The fundamental theorem bundles five characterizations with different
type signatures. This conjunction IS the theorem.

## Proof metaprogram for VCDim < ∞ → PACLearnable

The standard proof has three layers:
1. Sauer-Shelah: VCDim < ∞ → growth function is polynomial
   (Mathlib: card_shatterer_le_sum_vcDim, accessed via B₄ bridge)
2. Uniform convergence: polynomial growth + Hoeffding → ∀D, P[|emp_err - true_err| > ε] < δ
   (Mathlib: measure_sum_ge_le_of_iIndepFun for concentration)
3. ERM works: uniform convergence → any ERM learner PAC-learns C
   (Connects to BatchLearner via output_in_H)

The reverse direction PACLearnable → VCDim < ∞ uses a probabilistic
construction: if VCDim = ∞, construct a distribution D where any learner
fails with probability > δ for some ε.

/-- Direction ←: finite VCDim implies PAC learnability.

    PROOF ROUTE (via new infrastructure in Generalization.lean):
    Step 1: VCDim < ∞ → HasUniformConvergence (vcdim_finite_imp_uc)
      Sub-step 1a: Sauer-Shelah gives GrowthFunction bound
      Sub-step 1b: Symmetrization reduces UC to growth function counting
      Sub-step 1c: Concentration inequality closes the bound
    Step 2: HasUniformConvergence → PACLearnable (uc_imp_pac)
      Sub-step 2a: Construct ERM learner
      Sub-step 2b: ERM is consistent in realizable case
      Sub-step 2c: Consistent + UC → low TrueError

    The proof handles the empty concept class separately before constructing
    an ERM learner for the nonempty case.

    **Counterdefinition (COUNTER-4):** If the ERM approach fails for computational
    reasons (ERM is noncomputable, and we need a computable learner for
    computational learning theory), swap to the compression-based proof:
    VCDim < ∞ → finite compression scheme (Moran-Yehudayoff 2016)
    → compression scheme learner is PAC.
    **Swap condition:** When proving COMPUTATIONAL PAC learnability (polynomial time). -/
