# The family layer (issues #18, #19A)

The honest replacement for closure under *arbitrary external* ℕ-indexed families.  A fragment may
only be asked to contain the conjunctions and disjunctions that the admissible set itself **names**.

**This file is the syntax boundary.**  It defines the minimal data a coded family needs and nothing
else — no theory decoding, no `Sigma1`, no definition codes, no KP, no numbering.  Those are not
merely absent by convention: they are defined in files that import *this* one, so `CodedFamily`
cannot reach them even in principle.  `scripts/check_family_cone.lean` pins that permanently.

Three details are load-bearing and each was validated against the HF instance before being fixed:

1. `decode` lands in the structure's own arity — no independent arity field can drift.
2. The enumeration is supplied by the presentation (`indexEncodable`), keyed on the code, **not**
   found by instance search; the syntax a coded family builds therefore depends on the code.
3. `IsFamilyCode` is a **certificate**, absorbed into the code subtype rather than carried as a
   separate hypothesis.  Without it any code with any decoding would build a coded family, and
   "HF has no primitive coded families" would be unstatable.

`decodes_unique` makes decoding code-determined, which is what the extensionality API below rests
on.

## Main definitions

- `FamilyPresentation`: ambient `Element`, the `IsFamilyCode` subdomain, and the decoding data.
- `CodedFamily`, `codedIInf`, `codedISup`.

HF names no infinitary family, so its family layer is determined by `IsFamilyCode := False` and

depend on nothing else — in particular not on a full presentation carrying theory decoding or
`Sigma1`.
