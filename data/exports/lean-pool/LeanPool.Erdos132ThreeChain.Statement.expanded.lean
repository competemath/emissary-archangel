# The 3-chain support theorem

Let `X` be a finite set of points of the plane with squared diameter `D`.  This file forbids the
set of *non-diameter* squared distances of `X` from being a geometric 3-chain
`{a, 3a, 9a, …, 3 ^ (h-1) a}`, once `X` has at least thirteen points.

The lift from the five-point obstruction to arbitrary `n ≥ 13` runs through the *diameter graph*
of `X`, whose vertices are the points of `X` and whose edges join pairs at squared distance
exactly `D`.  Hopf--Pannwitz bounds that graph by `#X` edges, Caro--Wei then produces an
independent set of five points, and those five points have all ten of their squared distances
inside the chain — which `no_five_chain_finset` forbids.

Every ingredient is proved from first principles in this project: the chain-quadruple
catalogue, the five-point Gram obstruction, Caro--Wei, and Hopf--Pannwitz.  The result is
unconditional.  Of those, Hopf--Pannwitz is a supporting lemma only: the same bound already
exists in the pool as `LeanPool.Erdos132N14.diameterEdges_card_le`, and it is reproved here in
this project's model for self-containment, not offered as a new result.

There is no prior write-up to follow.  The 3-chain support statement was produced by the
author's automated research pipeline in August 2026; the cited source poses the ambient Erdős
problem and nothing more.  Section labels used in the docstrings of this development —
"chain-quadruple theorem", "five-point obstruction" — are internal names, not references to a
numbered result anywhere else.  Hopf--Pannwitz (1934) and Caro--Wei are classical statements,
but their Lean proofs here are written from scratch.
