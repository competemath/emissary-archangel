# Proof of Nivat's conjecture

Theorem 1.1 (`thm:main`) and its proof in Section 6 of `paper/nivat.tex`.

`nivat_rational` carries out strong induction over rectangle area. The exact
line ideal gives the smaller low-complexity rectangle of Corollary 2.3, and
`periodic_of_periodic_line_filter` returns from the filtered configuration using
Theorem 5.1. `nivat` then transfers periods through a rational alphabet labeling.
