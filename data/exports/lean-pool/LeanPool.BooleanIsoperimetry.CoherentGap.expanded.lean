# Coherent-gap certificates

This file formalizes the algebraic certificate mechanism behind normalized
chamber rigidity for a fixed coherent Boolean term order.  The motivating
order is the Conway--Guy order from:

* Tom Bohman, "A sum packing problem of Erdős and the Conway--Guy sequence,"
  Proceedings of the AMS 124 (1996), 3627--3636.

The definitions below do not assume Bohman's distinct-subset-sum theorem.
That theorem is needed only to identify integral unit relations with
consecutive gaps in the Conway--Guy subset-sum order.

The open-problem context and the exact boundary of this formalization are
recorded separately in the Construct research notes.

/-- **Normalized chamber rigidity.** An explicit principal/correction
recurrence makes the reference row a coordinatewise lower bound for every row
satisfying its unit-relation inequalities.

For the Conway--Guy order, the remaining concrete instantiation consists of:

1. the recurrence `W_(n+1) = (d_(n+1), d_(n+1) + W_n)`;
2. the block identity proving that each published principal relation has
   value one;
3. the triangular-index correction list and its basis-vector decomposition.

Bohman's distinct-subset-sum theorem is then used outside this algebraic
statement to identify the unit relations with consecutive order gaps. -/
