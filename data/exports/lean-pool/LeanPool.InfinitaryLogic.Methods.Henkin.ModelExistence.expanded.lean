# Model Existence Theorem

This file states the model existence theorem for Lω₁ω: any set of sentences
that belongs to a consistency property has a countable model.

## Main Results

- `model_existence`: If S is consistent (belongs to a consistency property),
  then S has a countable model. (Marker Theorem 4.1.2 / Keisler)

/-- **Model Existence Theorem** for Lω₁ω (Marker Theorem 4.1.2).

If a countable set S of Lω₁ω sentences in a countable language belongs to a
consistency property with equality axioms, then S has a countable model.

The proof proceeds by a Henkin-style construction:
1. Extend the language with countably many new constants
2. Extend S to a maximal consistent set S* using a priority argument
3. Build a term model from S*
4. Verify the model satisfies all sentences in S

The countability assumptions on the language and S are essential: without them,
a consistent set like {c_i ≠ c_j | i ≠ j} for uncountably many constants can
force any model to be uncountable.

This is the fundamental model-building tool for infinitary logic. -/

/-! ### Model existence over arbitrary (possibly uncountable) languages

The countability assumptions of `model_existence` are entirely **cosmetic** — they secure only
the *countable model* conclusion. The model-building core carries no countability hypothesis:
`ConsistencyProperty.exists_maximal` (Zorn), `TermModel`, `termModelStructure`, and `truthLemma`
have no `Countable` requirement anywhere in `Construction.lean` / `ConsistencyProperty.lean` (the
sole `Countable` in those files, at `Construction.lean:344`, is the `Countable (TermModel)`
instance, used only to certify a *countable* output). `model_existence`'s own
`_hS_countable : S.Countable` argument is underscore-prefixed — genuinely unused.

So dropping the gate yields model existence over an arbitrary language; the term model is
uncountable exactly when the language is. This is the cardinal-agnostic backend for the
EM/Skolem-hull realizability project (Phase 3 spike of the Morley–Hanf plan). Output-size
refinements (`#M ≥ #J`) are deferred — the goal here is modest (`∃ M, M ⊨ S`). -/
