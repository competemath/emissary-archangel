# Measurable Batch Learner Monad

MeasurableBatchLearner is a measurable instance of the pure ReaderSel monad
(MathLib/ReaderMonad.lean). The algebraic structure (pure, bind, monad laws)
lives in the pure math layer. This file adds the measurability certificate.

- `MeasLearner`: BatchLearner bundled with MeasurableBatchLearner proof
- `MeasLearner.pure`: constant learner (delegates to ReaderSel.pure)
- `MeasLearner.bind`: selection-based composition (delegates to concatLearner)
- Monad laws: inherited from ReaderSel, verified at evaluation level

/-- Monadic bind for measurable learners. Sequential composition where the second
learner is selected by a measurable function of the training sample, implemented via
`concatLearner` over a `UniformMeasurableBatchFamily` of continuations.

The non-trivial design choice is that `bind` requires a *uniformly* measurable family
of continuations rather than a merely pointwise measurable one. This is the type-level
encoding of the joint-measurability hypothesis without which sequential composition
would not stay inside `MeasurableBatchLearner`. The closure algebra proves the
construction is sound; the type signature makes the necessary hypothesis
non-bypassable. -/
