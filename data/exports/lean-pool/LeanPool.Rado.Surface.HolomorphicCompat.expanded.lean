# `C^1` compatibility over `ℂ` is holomorphic compatibility

The Radó statement takes its surface hypothesis in Mathlib's standard form,

```
[ChartedSpace ℂ X] [IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) 1 X]
```

and it is worth recording why that *is* the Riemann-surface hypothesis rather than a
weaker topological one, since the smoothness index `1` invites the opposite reading.

`IsManifold I n X` asks that the chart transitions lie in `contDiffGroupoid n I`, whose
defining property is `ContDiffOn 𝕜 n` for the field `𝕜` of the model `I`. For
`I = modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ` that field is `ℂ`, so the transitions are `C^1` **over
`ℂ`** — complex differentiable, not merely real differentiable. By Goursat a map that is
complex differentiable on an open set is holomorphic, hence analytic, so `C^1`
compatibility over `ℂ` already forces analytic compatibility.

The two results below make that precise, and they are the reason the hypothesis is not a
weakening:

* `contDiffGroupoid_one_le_omega_complex` — the `C^1` groupoid over `ℂ` is contained in
  the analytic one;
* `isManifold_omega_of_one` — hence a `C^1` charted space modelled on `ℂ` is an analytic
  (holomorphic) manifold, i.e. a Riemann surface.

Two contrasts are worth keeping in view. The genuinely topological hypothesis is index
`0`, not `1`: Mathlib proves `contDiffGroupoid_zero_eq : contDiffGroupoid 0 I =
continuousGroupoid H`, so `IsManifold I 0 X` is exactly a topological manifold and carries
no analytic content. And because `1 ≤ ω`, assuming `1` is the *weaker* hypothesis, so
proving Radó's theorem from it is strictly stronger than proving it from `ω`; by
`isManifold_omega_of_one` the two hypotheses are in fact equivalent here.
