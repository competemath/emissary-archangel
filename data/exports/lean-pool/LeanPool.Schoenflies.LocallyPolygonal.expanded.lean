# The plane minus finitely many open squares is locally polygonally connected

This is brick B5 of the polygonal-redrawing argument. The redrawing cuts an open axis-parallel
square out of the plane around each vertex of the graph; what the rest of the argument needs of
the leftover set `M` is that it is *locally polygonally connected* — every point of `M` has a
relatively open neighbourhood all of whose points are joined to each other by polygonal paths
running inside `M`. That is what feeds the clopen argument one level up (brick B6), where the
basic open piece is no longer a ball.

The informal description of the three basic shapes — a disk away from every square, a half-disk
against one side, a three-quarter disk at a corner — suggests an angular case analysis. There is
none here. Both the squares and the basic neighbourhoods are axis-parallel, so each shape is an
intersection of a small square with the complement of an open square, and

* the complement of an open square is the union of the four closed coordinate half-planes that
  bound it (`Plane.compl_openSquare_subset_iUnion`);
* intersecting with a small square gives four *rectangles*, each convex;
* if the small square is small enough, each of those rectangles is either empty or contains the
  centre `p` (`Plane.exists_radius_sides`).

A union of convex sets with a common point is polygonally connected by two segments through that
point, which is `isLocallyPolyConnAt_of_star`. The three shapes are then just the three ways the
list of nonempty pieces can come out (one, two adjacent, or two adjacent again with `p` on the
corner) and none of them has to be named.

The passage from one square to finitely many is a shrinking step: since the closed squares are
pairwise disjoint, a point lies in at most one of them, and a small enough neighbourhood of any
point misses all the others outright, so `M` looks locally exactly like the one-square case.

## Blueprint

* `PolyConnIn` — "joined by a polygonal path inside `S`"; the relation Lemma 1.1 produces.
* `IsLocallyPolyConn` — the local form of polygonal connectedness, brick B5's conclusion.
* `polyConnIn_of_convex`, `polyConnIn_union_of_convex` — a rectangle, and two rectangles that
  meet, are polygonally connected.
* `Plane.sideHalfPlane`, `Plane.sideGap` — the four half-planes bounding a square and the room
  between a point and each of them.
* `isLocallyPolyConnAt_compl_openSquare` — the one-square case: the complement of any open
  square is locally polygonally connected, at every point of the plane.
* `isLocallyPolyConn_compl_biUnion` — brick B5: the plane minus finitely many open squares with
  pairwise disjoint closures is locally polygonally connected.
