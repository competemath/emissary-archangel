# Equivariance of the pieces of the canonical labelling

This file works at the level of `IsoGraph.Canon.Algorithm`: raw `Array Nat`s, and permutations of
`{0, …, n-1}` represented as `Nat → Nat`.  The translation to `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` happens in
`IsoGraph/Canon/Spec.lean`.

Fix a renaming `σ` of the vertices and write `q ≈ p` for "the ordered partitions `q` and `p` have
the same cell boundaries, and the `i`-th cell of `q` is the `σ`-image of the `i`-th cell of `p`
*as a set*" (`PartEquiv`).  Only as a set: refinement's counting sort is stable, so the order
*within* a cell is inherited from the parent cell and therefore does depend on the vertex names.
What is invariant is the sequence of cells.

Each piece of the search respects `≈`:

* `Graph.ofOracle` transforms along a renaming, and the labelling really is a permutation of the
  vertices (`canonicalLabellingOfOracle` checks that at run time);
* `Part.WF` and `PartEquiv` are the vocabulary — "well-formed ordered partition" and "the same
  partition up to renaming" — that everything else is phrased in;
* `cellCount_equiv`: corresponding cells agree on every count; `countFrom_cellCount`: the
  counting phase of `refineStep` computes exactly such a count (`countFrom_equiv` combines the
  two); `countFrom_mem_touched`: the set of vertices that phase records is invariant too;
  `collect_equiv`: the two runs go on to split the very same list of cells, in the very same
  order;
* the two readers of a partition, `shapeHash` and `targetCell`, see only cell boundaries, so they
  agree on partitions related by any renaming;
* individualising corresponding vertices of related partitions gives related partitions, at the
  same position (`individualize_partEquiv`), and preserves well-formedness;
* two runs that reach related *discrete* partitions read off the same certificate
  (`certOf_of_partEquiv`, via `certOf_relabel`), with `discrete_of_targetCell_none` supplying
  the discreteness at the leaves.

The vocabulary the rest of the decomposition is phrased in.  Fix a renaming `σ` and think of two

"is" vertex `σ v` of the first.  The two runs do *not* produce partitions that agree positionwise
under `σ` — they both start from `Part.unit n`, whose `lab` is `Array.range n` in either run, and
refinement's counting sort is stable, so the order *within* a cell is inherited from the parent
and depends on vertex names.  What they do produce is partitions whose cells sit at the same

/-! ## Step 3 of the decomposition: individualisation

`individualize p v` splits `v` off to the front of its cell.  The two runs pick *different*
vertices to displace — `p.lab[c]` need not be `σ (q.lab[c])`, since the order inside a cell is
name-dependent — so the arrays are genuinely different.  What survives is exactly what `PartEquiv`
records: the cell boundaries move the same way, and a vertex other than the individualised one
lands in the second fragment of the old cell precisely when it was in that cell to begin with. -/

/-! ## What `refineStep` counts

`refineStep` is the one piece of the algorithm whose equivariance is *not* positionwise.  Every
other loop walks positions, and corresponding positions hold corresponding data; but the counting
phase walks a cell in `lab` order, and corresponding cells are related only as sets.  So the
quantity it computes has to be described set-theoretically before it can be shown invariant, and
that description is `cellCount`: the number of vertices of a given cell satisfying a predicate.

The arithmetic comes first (`cellCount_equiv`: the quantity is invariant), then the first of
`refineStep`'s loops (`countFrom_cellCount`: the loop computes the quantity). -/

/-! ### The counting loop

`countFrom` is phase (1) of `refineStep`: it walks the splitter cell `lab[s:e]` and, for every
vertex `w`, accumulates in `cnt[w]` the number of cell members adjacent to `w`.  Written as a
`for` loop this would be out of reach — see the note on `cenHashFrom` — so `Algorithm.lean` gives
it as a structural recursion on fuel, and the three lemmas below read the result off.

The bridge to `cellCount` is `List.count`: the inner loop bumps `cnt[w]` once per occurrence of
`w` in a neighbour list, and `Graph.ofOracle`'s neighbour lists are filtered ranges, hence
duplicate-free, so each cell member contributes at most one. -/

/-! ### Collecting the cells met by the splitter

Phase (2) of `refineStep` turns the touched vertices into the list of cells that have to be split.
Its output has to be canonical in a stronger sense than phase (1)'s: not just the same *set* of
cells in both runs, but the same *array*, since the step then processes them in order.  That is
what the sort is for, and why `sortNats` goes through `List.mergeSort` rather than `Array.qsort` —
`qsort` has no specification in this toolchain, and an unspecified order is exactly what cannot be
tolerated here.  `sortNats_ext` is the punchline of the sorting half ("duplicate-free arrays with
the same elements sort alike"), `collect_equiv` of the whole phase.

/-! ### The counting sort

The heart of `refineStep`: each cell that the splitter met is sorted by neighbour count.  The
sort is a counting sort in five passes — count the buckets (`bucketFrom`), turn the counts into
offsets (`offsetFrom`), scatter the vertices into a block (`scatterFrom`), write the block back
(`writeFrom`), install the new fragment boundaries (`boundsFrom`) — and each pass gets its own
`getElem!` characterisation here.  The one substantial argument is `scatterFrom_block`: the
scatter writes each vertex to a distinct slot, which needs the buckets' offset ranges to be
disjoint (`Sep`) and is what makes the whole thing a permutation of the cell.
