# The ambient isomorphism relation on coded structures

`isoSetoid φ` lives on the subtype `↥(ModelsOf φ)`, which means every statement about it is
implicitly a statement about a chosen Polish structure *on that subtype*.  For a perfect set
that is the wrong place to work: whether a set is perfect should be a fact about the ambient
`StructureSpace L`, not about a refinement chosen to make one particular model class Polish.

So the isomorphism relation is defined **once**, ambiently, as `structureIsoSetoid L`, and
`isoSetoid φ` *is* its pullback along the subtype inclusion — that is its definition, not a
theorem about it.  The sentence-level predicates below then quantify over perfect subsets of
`StructureSpace L` contained in `ModelsOf φ`, and the chosen refinement never enters their
statements.

/-! ### From a Polish refinement back to the ambient space

A Cantor antichain is built where the model class is well behaved — in a finer Polish topology
of the kind `modelsOf_isClopenable` supplies.  The perfect set, though, must be perfect in the
*ambient* `StructureSpace L`, or `IsThinOnNatModels` would be a statement about whichever
refinement happened to be chosen.

The two steps are ordered so that the delicate one never arises: coarsening is applied to the
**Cantor** antichain, where only continuity moves, and perfectness is then obtained in the
ambient space.  Nothing here asserts that perfectness survives coarsening — it does not in
general. -/
