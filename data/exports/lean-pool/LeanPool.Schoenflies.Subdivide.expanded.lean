# Subdividing a list of segments

A polygonal edge **is** its pair of endpoints: a straight segment is determined by its ends,
so naming one by anything else names a distinction that does not exist. `Piece := Plane ×
Plane`, and the blueprint's "represent every duplicate geometric subsegment only once"
becomes deduplication of a list of *names*, with no geometry in it.

**The subdivision recurses on the POINT list, not on the segment.** `subdivide pieces points`
cuts every current piece at the head point and recurses with the rest. Read literally the
blueprint wants the cut points as data, which would need a choice operator (the meets are
existential) and then a sort (to order them along each segment). Neither is required: order
does not matter, because cutting at a point that has already become an endpoint is a no-op.

Three facts about one cut, each lifted across the piece list and then across the point list:

* `subdivide_cover` — cutting loses nothing, so a subdivision occupies what it came from;
* `subdivide_ne` — no piece degenerates, so the drawing condition's invariant survives;
* `subdivide_interior_subset` — every piece's interior lies inside the interior of a piece
  it came from. This is what makes a cut **permanent**: nothing later can put a removed point
  back into an interior.

## Blueprint

* `Piece`, `cover` — the segment representation and what a list of them occupies.
* `subdivide` and its three properties — the cutting half of Lemma 3.7 (polygonal overlay).
