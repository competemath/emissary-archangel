# The theorem of the paper

The declarations here assemble the preceding modules into the unconditional
existence theorem of the paper “A 4AP-free permutation of the positive
integers”. For the closest match to the displayed theorem in the paper, see
`exists_fourAPFree_positive_permutation`, which uses positive integers both
as positions and as values, and an arbitrary nonzero integer difference.
Each existential statement below uses the explicit, verified construction.

/-- **The theorem of the paper.** There exists a permutation of the positive
integers containing no subsequence `a, a+r, a+2r, a+3r` with `r ≠ 0` in `ℤ`.

A Lean equivalence supplies both injectivity and surjectivity: no value is
repeated or omitted. The indices here are positive integers, matching the
paper's convention `a₁ a₂ …`. Negative common differences are included. -/
