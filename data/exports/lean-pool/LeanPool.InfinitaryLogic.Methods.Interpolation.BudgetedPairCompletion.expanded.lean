# Completing the budgeted labelled pair (issue #15)

The first consumer of `budgetedPairConsistencyProperty`.  It does one thing: run the fair Henkin
completion on the labelled root member and expose the result **opaquely**, as containment plus
`HenkinComplete`.

The internal `S* ⊆ GenU` fact is deliberately dropped.  The model endpoint should consume a
completion, not a subset of a particular universe, so that swapping the completion strategy cannot
ripple outward.

## Boundaries

* Countability of the generated universe is *derived*, not assumed: `genU_countable` needs only
  `[Countable (Σ l, L.Relations l)]`, which is the honest boundary here.
* **No `L.IsRelational`.**  Relationality is a requirement of the quotient term model, so it belongs
  to the model endpoint, not to completion.
* Finite constant support is accepted for `r₂` rather than for the labelled right root `r₂.not`, and
  converted locally — the interpolation consumer holds the former.

Stated with finite support of `r₂` rather than of `r₂.not`; the two are equal, but the
