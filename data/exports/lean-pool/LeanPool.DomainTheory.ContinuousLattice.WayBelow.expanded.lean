# The induced (Scott) topology and the way-below relation (Scott 1972, §2)

This file formalizes the core of Scott's §2 *Continuous Lattices*: the topology a
complete
lattice carries intrinsically (Scott's "induced topology", today the **Scott
topology**),
the **way-below relation** `≪`, the basic properties of `≪` (Scott's Proposition
2.2), and
the definition of a **continuous lattice** (Scott's Definition 2.3).

Scott defines the induced topology on a partially ordered set `D` by declaring `U`
open iff

* (i)  `U` is an upper set; and
* (ii) whenever `S ⊆ D` is directed (and, in this paper, non-empty), `⊔S` exists
and
       `⊔S ∈ U`, then `S ∩ U ≠ ∅`.

He then defines `x ≪ y` ("`x` is way below `y`") to mean `y ∈ interior {z | x ⊑
z}`, the
interior being taken in this induced topology. We encode "Scott-open" as the
predicate
`ScottOpen` and `≪` as `WayBelow`, witnessing the interior by a Scott-open
neighbourhood
contained in the principal up-set `Set.Ici x = {z | x ≤ z}`. This is faithful to
Scott's
topological definition (rather than the order-theoretic shortcut), and as a result
Scott's
Proposition 2.2 (vi) and (vii) fall straight out of the open-set axioms.

This is the classical/topological version of the theory, so we reason classically.

is directed
(using directedness of `{· ≪ x}` twice) and has supremum `c` (using continuity
twice). Hence
`a ≪ c = ⊔M` with `M` directed forces `a ≪ m` for some `m ∈ M`, say `m ≪ x ≪ c`;
