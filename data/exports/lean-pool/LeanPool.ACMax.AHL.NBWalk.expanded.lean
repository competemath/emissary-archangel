# Non-backtracking walks — the foundation of the AHL irregular-Moore ladder

This file begins the non-backtracking-walk proof of the irregular Moore bound
of Alon, Hoory and Linial ("The Moore bound for irregular graphs", *Graphs and
Combinatorics* **18** (2002), 53–57). The imported dependency closure includes
walk counting (`NBWalkCount`, `NBWeighted`), stationary weighted marginals
(`AHLStationary`, `AHLMarginals`), weighted AM–GM (`AHLAmGm`), and the resulting
ball bound `ahl_ball_moore` and girth bound `ahl_ball_girth_bound` in `Band.Sum`.

This file lands the *non-backtracking walk* machinery the bound is counted over.  A walk is
**non-backtracking** when it never immediately reverses a step: `w.getVert (i + 2) ≠ w.getVert i`
for every valid `i`.  This is the exact `getVert` form the SQRT ray/ball rows consume.

## Contents

* **`IsNonBacktracking`** — the predicate, plus its basic API (`nil` and length-`≤ 1` walks are
  non-backtracking; every path is non-backtracking).
* **`nb_walk_isPath_of_girth`** — the injectivity core: under the landed girth hypothesis (no cycle
  of length `≤ 2r + 1`), every non-backtracking walk of length `≤ r` is a **path**.  This
  generalizes the ray-growth injectivity `exists_isPath_len_of_min_two` (that grew *one* such path;
  here *every* non-backtracking walk is one).  The proof peels the first edge, so the tail is a
  non-backtracking walk of length `≤ r` hence a path by induction; a revisit of the start vertex
  then supplies two distinct short paths to it, closing a cycle of length `≤ r ≤ 2r + 1`.
* **`nb_extension_count`** — the `deg − 1` branching atom: the neighbours of `y` other than the
  arrived-from vertex `z` number `deg y − 1`.  This is the per-step count the future AM-GM-weighted
  AHL count consumes.

## Scope note

The degree-weighted lower bound on the *number* of non-backtracking walks and the weighted AM-GM
assembly into the Moore bound are the follow-up counting node; this file lands the foundation only.
