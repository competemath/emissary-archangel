# Bounded configurations with vanishing higher differences

This module proves Lemma 3.4 (`lem:repeated`) of `paper/nivat.tex` and the
parallel case of Theorem 5.1. Boundedness rules out a nonzero affine slope along
a lattice orbit; boundedness of differences then reduces every positive order
to the first difference.

The main results are `difference_eq_zero_of_iterate_of_bounded`, its finite-range
specialization `difference_eq_zero_of_iterate`, and
`periodic_of_parallel_mixed_difference`. Finite-range closure lemmas also support
the orbit-closure difference in Corollary 3.6 (`cor:periodic-difference`).
