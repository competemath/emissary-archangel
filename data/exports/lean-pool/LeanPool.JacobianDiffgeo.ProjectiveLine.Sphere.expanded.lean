# The challenge bridge: `ℙ¹ ≃ₜ` the unit 2-sphere (CC5)

Unit: projective-line (`docs/design/projective-line.md` §3.4). Mathlib already contains the
topological homeomorphism from a one-point compactification of a finite-dimensional real vector
space to the unit sphere in a Euclidean space of one higher dimension
(`onePointEquivSphereOfFinrankEq`); specializing it to `V := ℂ` (as a 2-dimensional real vector
space) and `ι := Fin 3` gives exactly the sphere model used by the challenge's
`genus_eq_zero_iff_homeo`.

`homeoSphere` has no closed-form pointwise description (mathlib's construction selects a
`ContinuousLinearEquiv` via `Nonempty.some`); no consumer needs one (see design §3.4).
