# The reverse binary order

This file formalizes the order `◁` introduced before Lemma 1 in the paper
“A 4AP-free permutation of the positive integers”.  The least significant
unequal bit decides the comparison, with `1` preceding `0`.  Dividing by two
removes a common least significant bit.  We use this recursive description
both for a computable comparison and for the elementary proofs in the paper.
