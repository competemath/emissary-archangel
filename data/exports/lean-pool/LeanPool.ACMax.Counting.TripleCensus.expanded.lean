# A six-column three-group census

This file isolates the small arithmetic obstruction used at the order-15
endpoint of the shared-star moat.  Each column records how many of its three
incidences land in three two-vertex groups.  If too few pairs are repeated
inside the groups and across the first group, the six columns cannot exist.

/-- Six triples with entries at most two and column sum three cannot have
first-coordinate sum six while all three indicated pair counts stay small.

The three indicator sums count repeated pairs within the groups.  The product
sums count pairs crossing the first group with the other two groups. -/
