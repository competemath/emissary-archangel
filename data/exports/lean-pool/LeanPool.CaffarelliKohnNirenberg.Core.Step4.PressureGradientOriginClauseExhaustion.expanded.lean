# Exhausting an open order-connected set of times by compact order-connected sets

A set `I ⊆ ℝ` that is open and order-connected is the increasing union of compact
order-connected subsets, and every compact subset of `I` is already contained in one of
them. Concretely, for each `n : ℕ` we take the points whose `1 / (n + 1)`-neighbourhood
lies in `I` and which themselves lie in the ambient interval `[-n, n]`, and then we close
that set. Each stage is compact, order-connected, contained in `I`, the stages increase,
their union is all of `I`, and compact subsets are absorbed because a compact subset of an
open set has a positive Lebesgue number.

This is the elementary device that turns a local, bounded-time construction on an open
order-connected time interval into a construction on the whole interval: every compact
piece of the interval is contained in a single compact stage.
