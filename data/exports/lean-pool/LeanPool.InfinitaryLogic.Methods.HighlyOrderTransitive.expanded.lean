# Highly order-transitive linear orders

The order-theoretic input of the countably-many-types project (issue #11, Marker Theorem 11.2):
a linear order is **highly order-transitive** when every isomorphism between two finite
increasing tuples extends to an order automorphism. Combined with the local EM equivariance
package (`Methods/LocalEMEquivariance.lean`), such automorphisms of the skeleton induce
structure automorphisms of the term model moving any increasing tuple of skeleton constants to
any other, which is what collapses tuple types to finitely describable orbit data.

This file supplies the consumer-shaped definition. Existence results via ordered fields are in
`HighlyTransitiveField.lean` and `HighlyTransitiveExistence.lean`.
