# The language of the paper

This file fixes the conventions used to formalize the paper
“A 4AP-free permutation of the positive integers”.  The construction takes place
in `ℕ`, which in Lean includes zero.  The final theorem shifts the values by one.

An arithmetic progression is expressed using the two equations
`a + c = 2 * b` and `b + d = 2 * c`.  For natural-number entries these equations,
together with `a ≠ b`, are equivalent to having a nonzero **integer** common
difference.  Thus decreasing progressions are included throughout.
