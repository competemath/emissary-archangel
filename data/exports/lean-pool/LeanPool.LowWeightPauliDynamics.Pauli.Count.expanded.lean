# How many Paulis LPD stores: `O(n^{w*})`

The number of Pauli classes on `n` qubits of weight at most `w` is at most `C(n,w) · 4^w`, hence
at most `4^w · n^w`. This is the counting step of `apd:thm:lightcone` and `apd:thm:runtime`: an
observable truncated at weight `w*` contains `O(n^{w*})` Pauli operators, and the time
`O((r+1) · n^{w*})` and memory `O(n^{w*})` of `apd:thm:runtime` are built on that count.

**Scope.** `apd:thm:runtime` itself is not formalized in this library; only this count is. The
rest of that theorem combines the truncation-error analysis (the entanglement hypothesis of
`apd:thm:triangle`, the short-time condition `t < t₀`, and the formula for `w*`, of which this
library proves the existence form `exists_uniform_weight_cutoff`) with a *computational cost
model*: a data structure indexed by supports, with `O(1)` access to a coefficient. A cost model is
not something this library formalizes; it could only enter as a declared assumption. The counting
step is the opposite: pure combinatorics, independent of all of those, and it is what makes
`n^{w*}` polynomial rather than exponential in `n` at fixed `w*`.

**The bound is `C(n,w) · 4^w`, and it is loose in two stated ways.** It double-counts classes of
weight `< w`, which lie in several `w`-element supersets, and it allows a site inside the chosen
support to be the identity, giving `4` where an exact count gives `3`. Both are the price of
avoiding a fiberwise exact count, and neither affects the `O(n^w)` conclusion. `card_lowSet_le`
is an explicit inequality where the paper writes `O(·)`, and an upper bound is the direction that
matters: an upper bound on the number of stored Paulis is what bounds the runtime.

## Main definitions

* `lowSet n w`: the Pauli classes of weight at most `w`, the complement of `highSet n w`. These
  are the classes a weight-`w` truncation retains.
* `psupp p`: the sites at which the class `p` is not the identity.
* `vanishOff S`: the classes that are the identity outside the set of sites `S`.

## Main results

* `card_vanishOff`: exactly `4 ^ S.card` classes are the identity outside `S`.
* `card_lowSet_le`: `(lowSet n w).card ≤ n.choose w * 4 ^ w` for `w ≤ n`.
* `card_lowSet_le_pow`: `(lowSet n w).card ≤ 4 ^ w * n ^ w` for `w ≤ n`.

/-- **The stored set is polynomial in `n` for fixed `w`.**

`apd:thm:runtime` uses that an observable truncated at weight `w*` contains `O(n^{w*})` Pauli
operators. This is that count, with the constant explicit rather than inside an `O(·)`.

Every class of weight `≤ w` has its support inside some `w`-element set, and the classes supported
in a fixed `S` number exactly `4^{|S|}` (`card_vanishOff`) — so the union over all `C(n,w)` choices
of `S` bounds the whole stored set. The bound is not tight: it double-counts classes of weight
`< w`, which lie in several `S`. `4` rather than `3` for the same reason — a site inside `S` is
allowed to be the identity. Both are the price of avoiding a fiberwise exact count, and neither
affects the `O(n^w)` conclusion this is here to supply. -/
