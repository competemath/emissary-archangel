# The Dillon--Kashyap phase formula, as a hypothesis

The one statement this development takes from the literature is fixed here as
a `Prop`-valued *definition*, never as an `axiom`.  Nothing is assumed
globally: every theorem that uses it carries it as an explicit hypothesis, and
`MCM/PhaseFormula.lean` then discharges it internally, so `#print axioms` on the final
theorem lists only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

Provenance: Theorems 1--2 of J. F. Dillon and N. Kashyap, *Jacobi-like sums and
difference sets with Singer parameters*, Australas. J. Combin. 55 (2013),
49--63.  Their Theorem 1 gives the Fourier coefficient
`G(χ) G(χ^(2^k+1)) / G(χ³)` and their Theorem 2 identifies the corresponding
difference set as the complement of this same `Δ`; the sign convention here is
therefore opposite to theirs.
