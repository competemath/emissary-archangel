# Truncation, and the ladder for the flow LPD actually runs

`Pauli/Flow.lean` builds `pauliLadder` over `traj`, the **untruncated** Heisenberg trajectory
`O^{(g)} = U_g† O U_g`. LPD does not run that flow: it discards every Pauli above the weight
threshold `w*` and carries the truncated observable `Õ^{(d)}_{≤w*}` forward. The component
discarded at Trotter step `d`, `Õ^{(d)}_{≥w*+1} = (1 - Π_{≤w*}) U_tilde† Õ^{(d-1)}_{≤w*} U_tilde`
(`apd:eq:step_component`), is the object the error accounting of `apd:thm:triangle` sums.
This file defines the truncation as an operator, defines the trajectory with truncations
interleaved, and proves that the damped ladder of `apd:thm:local_flow_k_local` survives arbitrary
interleaved restrictions. `Pauli/TrotterTruncate.lean` then specializes to the algorithm's
schedule: a named boundary schedule, a step recurrence, and the discarded-operator identity.

## Main definitions

* `PauliString.truncOp`: the truncation `∑_{p ∈ S} x_p P_p` of an operator to a set `S` of Pauli
  classes; it is `Π_{≤ w*}` at `S = (highSet n w*)ᶜ`.
* `PauliString.trajTrunc`: the trajectory that conjugates by one rotation and then truncates to
  `S g`, for a family `S : ℕ → Finset (PauliIndex n)` of retained sets.
* `PauliString.ladderNTrunc`: the family of high-weight norms along `trajTrunc`.
* `PauliString.pauliLadderTrunc`, `PauliString.pauliWeightedLadderTrunc`,
  `PauliString.pauliLadderTruncAt`: the `Ladder` and `WeightedLadder` instances over `trajTrunc`.

## Main results

* `PauliString.coeff_truncOp`, `PauliString.coeffVec_truncOp`: `truncOp S` keeps the coefficients
  in `S` and zeroes the rest; on coefficient vectors it is `restr S`.
* `PauliString.truncOp_univ`, `PauliString.sum_coeff_smul_toMatrix_herm`: completeness of the
  Pauli expansion, `O = ∑_P x_P P`.
* `PauliString.highNorm_truncOp_le`, `PauliString.pauliNorm_truncOp_le`,
  `PauliString.highNorm_truncOp_compl`: truncation only removes mass, and `Π_{≤ w}` leaves none
  above `w`.
* `PauliString.trajTrunc_univ`: truncating nothing recovers `traj`.
* `PauliString.highNorm_conj_trajTrunc_le`, `PauliString.ladderNTrunc_step`: the flow bound
  before and after the truncation of a step.

The mathematical content is a single observation. Truncating zeroes some Pauli coefficients and
leaves the others alone, so no high-weight norm `N_{≥m}` can increase under it; the flow recursion
therefore remains valid when truncations are inserted between the rotations, which is how
`apd:cor:norm_cumulation_jump` is applied to the LPD trajectory. `Flow.lean`'s
`highNorm_restr_le` is the monotonicity half of that observation, on the coefficient side.
`truncOp` supplies the *operator* to apply it to and `trajTrunc` the *trajectory* to interleave
it into.

## The truncation is an operator here, not a projector on a space

`truncOp S O := ∑_{p ∈ S} x_p P_p` rebuilds the observable from the retained coefficients. It is
`Π_{≤ w*}` at `S = (highSet n w*)ᶜ`, and it is stated at a general `S` because nothing below needs
`S` to be a weight cut. That generality is not decoration: **LPD truncates at the end of a Trotter
step, not after every rotation** (this is the setting of `apd:thm:triangle`), and `trajTrunc`
takes a *family* `S : ℕ → Finset`, so `S g = univ` at the rotations inside a step and
`S g = (highSet n w*)ᶜ` at its boundary is the algorithm's own schedule. `trajTrunc_univ` shows
the constant-`univ` family recovers `traj` on the nose.

That last statement needs `truncOp univ O = O`, i.e. **completeness of the Pauli expansion**. It
needs neither a `finrank` count nor an `InnerProductSpace` instance on `Matrix`: Parseval
(`sum_norm_coeff_sq`) plus the reproducing property (`coeff_truncOp`) gives it in a dozen lines,
because a difference with vanishing coefficients has vanishing `‖·‖_{2,normalized}`, hence
vanishing entries.
`truncOp_univ` is that proof.

## What the truncated ladder does and does not say

`pauliLadderTrunc` needs **exactly `pauliLadder`'s hypotheses** — Hermitian `k_h`-local generators,
a `k_o`-local observable, `a` dominating every `|sin(θ_g)|` — and **nothing whatever about `S`**.
Not that it is a weight cut, not that `w* ≥ k_o`, not that the schedule is periodic. Truncation
only ever removes mass, so an arbitrary family of retained sets is safe. Anything stronger in the
statement would be an artefact.

Two readings to keep apart, because the ladder is on one side of the truncation and the error is
on the other.

* `ladderNTrunc m g` is the high-weight mass of the observable **after** step `g`'s truncation.
  At the truncation rung it is zero by construction (`highNorm_truncOp_compl`) and says nothing.
* The quantity the error analysis sums is the mass **discarded** at step `g`, i.e. the high-weight
  part of the conjugate *before* truncation — the norm of the discarded component of
  `apd:eq:step_component`. That is `highNorm_conj_trajTrunc_le`, and it is the sharper statement:
  the ladder step is what is left of it after `highNorm_truncOp_le` throws mass away.

This file supplies general restriction trajectories. `Pauli/TrotterTruncate.lean` identifies the
discard at the algorithm's schedule, `Pauli/TruncationError.lean` proves the telescoping bound of
`apd:thm:triangle` at the level of Pauli norms, and `Pauli/LayerError.lean` derives the
quantitative bound on the discarded mass that `total_truncation_error` (`Constants/Total.lean`)
takes as its hypothesis `hstep`. The passage to expectation values in a physical state and the
Trotter approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution are separate from all of this.

As in `Flow.lean`, everything is stated with the closed-form rotation `rot` and the entrywise
matrices `toMatrix`; their identification with the matrix exponential and with tensor products is
proved in `RotationExp.lean` and `Pauli/Tensor.lean`.

its boundary, which the general `S`-family form of `pauliLadderTrunc` expresses. The per-rotation
