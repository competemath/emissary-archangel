# Perfect and Cantor antichains, and thinness

The vocabulary a dichotomy theorem is stated in, separated from any particular dichotomy.

* `HasPerfectAntichainOn r A` — a nonempty perfect subset of `A` of pairwise `r`-inequivalent
  points;
* `HasCantorAntichainOn r A` — a *continuous* Cantor-space parametrization of such an antichain,
  the constructive form the Cantor-scheme builders actually produce;
* `IsThinOn r A` — the negation of the first.

The two positive forms are related by `HasPerfectAntichainOn.hasCantorAntichainOn`, which is
`Perfect.exists_nat_bool_injection` plus bookkeeping.  Injectivity of a Cantor antichain is not
an extra hypothesis: it follows from *reflexivity* of the setoid, since distinct arguments have
inequivalent images and every point is equivalent to itself.

The file also carries the cardinal facts these statements are measured against: a nonempty
perfect set in a complete metric space has size continuum (`Perfect.mk_eq_continuum`); a
perfect transversal forces continuum-many classes (`continuum_classes_of_perfect_transversal`,
with its two-sided companion); and a Polish space, hence any quotient of one, has at most
continuum-many points (`mk_le_continuum_of_polish`, `mk_quotient_le_continuum_of_polish`).
None of them mentions a dichotomy, an equivalence relation being closed, or a splitting
hypothesis.

**Hypotheses are kept minimal, and the ordering below is what makes that possible.**  Only three
results need `SecondCountableTopology`: the two Polish cardinality bounds and the *upper* half of
`Perfect.mk_eq_continuum`.  Everything else needs at most `MetricSpace` + `CompleteSpace` (for the
Cantor injection) or nothing beyond `TopologicalSpace`.  In particular
`continuum_classes_of_perfect_transversal` is proved through the Cantor antichain rather than
through `mk_eq_continuum`, which is what lets it drop second countability — it only ever needed
the lower bound.
