# The signed Boolean formulation

The final paragraph of Section 5 of arXiv:2609.19123 changes conventions from
`{0,1}`-valued functions to `{-1,1}`-valued functions by `h = 2g - 1`.
This file verifies that conversion, the positive-part and Fourier identities,
and the resulting signed version of the weighted star inequality.
