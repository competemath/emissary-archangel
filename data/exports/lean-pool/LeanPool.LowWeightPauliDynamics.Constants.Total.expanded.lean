# A time threshold from model parameters, and the summed truncation error

This file defines the threshold `tZeroModel = 1/(2 Γ (k_h−1) α)`, which depends on model
parameters only, together with the decay base `q = t/t₀`, and proves `total_truncation_error`:
the norm-level form of the summed bound of `apd:thm:one_step_truncation_error` with that
threshold.

## Main definitions

* `tZeroModel`: the threshold `t₀ = 1/(2 Γ (k_h−1) α)`.
* `decayBase`: the decay base `q = t/t₀`.

## Main results

* `tZeroModel_le_tZero`, `lt_tZero_of_lt_tZeroModel`: the model threshold is at most the paper's
  `t₀ = 1/(c₀ Γ (k_h−1) α)`, so `t < tZeroModel` implies `t < t₀`.
* `decayBase_lt_one`, `pow_decayBase_antitone`: `q < 1` below the threshold, and `q^{m+1}` decays
  in `m`.
* `total_truncation_error`: the summed truncation bound with `t₀ = tZeroModel`.

## A threshold depending on model parameters only

The paper's threshold (`apd:eq:time_condition`) is

  `t₀ = 1/(c₀ Γ (k_h−1) α)`,

where the constant `c₀` of `apd:eq:c0` depends on `m*` and `r`, and through its third factor
`(1+4eβ)^{1/(m*+1)}`, with `β = 2e·w₂·sin(dt)` and `sin(dt) ≤ αt/r`, also on `t`. The rung `m*`
is in turn chosen in terms of `log(t₀/t)` (`apd:thm:truncation_threshold_entangled`).

`tZeroModel` below is

  `t₀ := 1/(2 · Γ · (k_h−1) · α)`,

with the literal `2` in place of `c₀`. Its type is `ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ`, taking `Γ`, `k_h`, `α`:
there is no `m*`, no `r`, no `c₀` and no `t`. The decay base `q = t/t₀` is therefore fixed before
`m*` and `r` are chosen, and the parameters can be fixed in the order

  `t₀ → q := t/t₀ → m* → w* = k_o + m*(k_h−1) → r`.

That the substitution is *sound* rather than merely convenient is `tZeroModel_le_tZero`: since
`c₀ ≤ 2` under the hypotheses of `Lean4LPD.cZero_le_two` (`m* ≥ 1`, `r ≥ 5`, `B ≤ 1`), the model
threshold is at most the paper's, so `t < t₀^model` implies `t < t₀`. It is a conservative form of
the paper's condition — it can only shrink the admissible window, never enlarge it.
`cZero_le_two_sharp` permits the slightly better **uniform** constant `(384/275)√2`; the ratio
1.0128 compares those two uniform choices only. It is not an upper bound on the loss relative to
the instance-dependent `c₀`: that ratio is `2/c₀`, and can approach two.

The uniform bound `cZero_le_two` is what licenses the substitution: without a bound on `c₀` that
holds for all admissible `(r, m*, Γ)` there would be nothing to compare `tZeroModel` against.

## The `hstep` hypothesis, and where it is discharged

`total_truncation_error` takes the per-step summed bound `hstep` as an argument, which keeps this
file purely scalar. It is deliberately a hypothesis of a theorem rather than a global assumption,
so it stays visible in the statement.

**It is not a hypothesis of the library as a whole.** The derivation of that bound — the `Γ`
layers of each Trotter step, the absorption of the last jump into the chain below it, and
`sum_choose_mul_le` — is assembled on top of `MultiLadder.le_majorant`:
`Lean4LPD.Ladder.ChainBound` for the block inflow and the shifted-chain slot sum,
`Lean4LPD.Constants.AssemblyBound` for the `D`-sector estimate, with
`MultiLadder.sum_block_epsJump_le_cZero` concluding exactly the shape `hstep` asks for.
`Lean4LPD.Pauli.LayerError` instantiates that against `pauliMultiLadder`, so at Pauli level no
caller supplies it either. All of this is at the level of the normalized Pauli 2-norm; the
conversion to an error in expectation (`apd:thm:triangle`) is not part of this file.

/-- **The summed truncation error, with a threshold free of `c₀`.**

Given the summed bound in the `c₀` form of `apd:eq:total_high_weight_norm` (`hstep`, the
hypothesis discussed in the module docstring), the bound may be restated with `t₀` taken from
model parameters:

  `S ≤ (t/t₀)^{m*+1} · (∏_{i=1}^{m*+1}(i+c)) / (m*+1)! · ‖O‖`,   `t₀ = 1/(2Γ(k_h−1)α)`.

Two things happen in the algebra and both matter. `c₀ ≤ 2` (`Lean4LPD.cZero_le_two`, whence the
hypotheses `hm1`, `hr5`, `hB0`, `hB1`) replaces the parameter-dependent constant by a literal,
and then the `(k_h−1)^{m*+1}` produced by `prod_rungW_eq` is **absorbed exactly** into the decay
base: since `1/t₀ = 2Γ(k_h−1)α`, one has `(2Γαt)^{m*+1} · (k_h−1)^{m*+1} = (t/t₀)^{m*+1}`. So
besides offsetting the factorial `(m*+1)!` (compare `apd:rmk:comparison`), the rung product is
what supplies the factor `k_h − 1` of the threshold.

The conclusion is the norm-level content of `apd:eq:total_truncation_error` *before* the product
`∏_{i=1}^{m*+1}(i+c)` is estimated. That estimate, `∏_{i=1}^{n}(i+c) ≤ n!·(e·n)^c`, is
`prod_add_one_le_factorial_exp_rpow`; `total_truncation_error_product_bound` composes the two and
is the version downstream code uses. The statement is about real numbers `S` and `M`, standing
for the summed high-weight norm and `‖O‖`; no conversion to an error in expectation is made
here. -/
