# Silver's Theorem for Borel Equivalence Relations

This file provides:
1. `gandy_harrington_for_relation`: Silver's theorem for Borel equivalence
   relations on Polish spaces — a Borel equivalence relation with uncountably
   many classes contains a perfect set of pairwise-inequivalent points.
2. `silver_core_polish`: the dichotomy form (countable quotient or perfect
   set of inequivalent points), derived as a thin wrapper.
3. `silverBurgessDichotomy`: the full dichotomy for standard Borel spaces.

The **equality case** `gandy_harrington_for_eq` (via Cantor–Bendixson) is kept as a simple
direct proof of the smooth end of the dichotomy.

**Why there was no easy reduction to a "closed relation" case.** A tempting plan is to refine
the Polish topology so the Borel relation becomes *closed* and then run a Cantor scheme. This
is invalid in general: a closed equivalence relation on a Polish space is *smooth* (the class
map `x ↦ [x]` into the Effros–Borel space is Borel), so "potentially closed ⟹ smooth". But
`E₀` (eventual equality on `2^ℕ`) is a Borel equivalence relation with continuum-many classes
— so Silver applies — that is **not** smooth (Glimm–Effros), hence not potentially closed. So
the hard core of Silver is exactly the non-smooth relations — the `G₀`-dichotomy content of
the category route.

/-- **Silver's theorem for Borel equivalence relations.** A Borel equivalence
relation on a Polish space with uncountably many classes contains a perfect set
of pairwise-inequivalent points: there is a continuous injection
`f : (ℕ → Bool) → α` such that distinct inputs produce r-inequivalent outputs.

Proved via Miller's classical category route: the `G₀`-dichotomy homomorphism
(`gSGraphHomHypothesis_holds`, by the fusion construction `G0Fusion.exists_gsGraph_hom`),
Miller's independence lemma, Kuratowski–Ulam, and Mycielski's theorem, assembled by
`gandy_harrington_of_gSGraphHom`. -/
