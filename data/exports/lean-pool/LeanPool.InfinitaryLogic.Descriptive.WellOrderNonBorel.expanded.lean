# Non-Borelness of the countable well-order class (issue #33)

The descriptive-set-theoretic payoff of Marker's boundedness theorem: the class **WO** of
countable well-orders is **not Borel** as a subset of the logic space.

```
theorem wellOrderClass_not_measurableSet (lt : L.Relations 2) : ¬ MeasurableSet (wellOrderClass lt)
```

Were it Borel, López–Escobar (#10) would give a sentence `φ` with `ModelsOf φ = WO` — but only
over **coded** structures, whose carrier is `ℕ`.  The bridge from there to arbitrary models is
the fragment-elementary substructure machinery (#13), applied to `φ ⊓ infiniteAxiom` so that
finite models cannot escape:

* `exists_countable_defect_seed` — a structure whose distinguished relation is not a well-order
  carries a **countable nonempty seed** of witnesses (a trichotomy or transitivity failure, or
  the range of an infinite descending sequence) whose presence forces the same failure in every
  subset containing it;
* `isWellOrder_of_realize` — hence every model of `φ ⊓ infiniteAxiom` is well-ordered: seed a
  countable fragment-elementary substructure with the defect, transport it to the carrier `ℕ`,
  and the resulting code would be a member of `ModelsOf φ = WO` that is not a well-order.

Marker's Corollary 4.27 then bounds the order types of all models of `φ ⊓ infiniteAxiom` by a
single countable ordinal, which `exists_code_type_eq` contradicts.
