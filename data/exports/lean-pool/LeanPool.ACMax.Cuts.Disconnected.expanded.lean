# A disconnected graph has algebraic connectivity at most `2`

If the vertex set splits as `A ⊔ Aᶜ` (both nonempty) with no edges between the parts,
then the cut is empty, so the weighted-cut certificate gives `algConn G ≤ 2` (indeed
`algConn G = 0`).  This handles disconnected graphs uniformly for every `n`.
