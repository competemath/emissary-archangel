# Continuous lattice constructions (Scott 1972, §2.8–2.12)

The Milner correction (March 1972, pp. 135–136) is in `MilnerCorrection.lean`.
Full proofs of
2.8–2.12 under `CoarserThanScottTopology` are the remaining 1972 items; the
Sierpiński
injectivity base case (1.2) is already complete.

This file additionally proves Scott's first two example/closure results, the
order-theoretic
content of Propositions 2.8 (finite lattices are continuous) and 2.9 (products of
continuous
lattices are continuous). The accompanying topological claims of 2.9–2.10 ("the
induced
topology agrees with the product / subspace topology") are the parts that require
the Milner
correction and remain open.

The key step is that if `a ≪ yᵢ` in the factor `Dᵢ`, then the cylinder element
`[a]ⁱ`
(equal to `a` in coordinate `i` and `⊥` elsewhere) is way below `y` in the
product: the
preimage `{z | zᵢ ∈ U}` of a Scott-open witness `U ⊆ Dᵢ` is Scott-open in the

(suprema are computed coordinatewise). Any upper bound `b` of `{x | x ≪ y}`
therefore
dominates every `[a]ⁱ`, so `a = ([a]ⁱ)ᵢ ≤ bᵢ`; ranging over `a ≪ yᵢ` and using
continuity of
`Dᵢ` gives `yᵢ ≤ bᵢ` for all `i`, i.e. `y ≤ b`. -/

/-! ### Proposition 2.9(b): the induced topology of a product is the product
topology

Scott 1972, Proposition 2.9 also asserts that the Scott topology of the product
`∏ᵢ Dᵢ` of
continuous lattices coincides with the topological product of the Scott topologies
of the factors.
We prove the two inclusions:

* **Product ⊆ Scott** (`scottTopologicalSpace ≤ Pi.topologicalSpace`): every
projection
  `eval i` preserves directed suprema (they are computed coordinatewise), hence is
  Scott-continuous,
  hence the Scott topology of the product is finer than each induced topology,
  i.e. finer than their
  infimum (the product topology).
* **Scott ⊆ Product** (`Pi.topologicalSpace ≤ scottTopologicalSpace`): given a
Scott-open `U` and a
  point `z ∈ U`, the `↟a` basis (`exists_wayBelow_Ici_subset`) yields `a ≪ z` with
  `↑a ⊆ U`. A
  way-below element of a product has **finite support**
  (`wayBelow_finite_support`) and is
  way-below in each coordinate (`wayBelow_proj`); the resulting finite box
  `⋂_{i ∈ F} eval i ⁻¹' (↟aᵢ-neighbourhood of zᵢ)` is a product-open neighbourhood
  of `z` inside
  `↑a ⊆ U`. -/
