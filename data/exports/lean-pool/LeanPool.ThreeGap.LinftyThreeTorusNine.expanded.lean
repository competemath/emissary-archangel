# The `L∞` three-torus bound `g_∞ ≤ 2^d+1` is **sharp** for `d = 3`: nine distances attained

The repo's `SimDirichlet.nnDist_count_unconditional` proves the sup-norm bound `g_∞ ≤ 2^d + 1` in
all
dimensions (Shutov), i.e. `≤ 9` for `d = 3`. Haynes–Marklof–Ramirez
([arXiv:2010.08842](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08842), *Higher dimensional gap theorems for the
maximum metric*, IJNT 17 (2021)) prove this bound is **sharp for `d ≤ 3`**, and give an explicit
`d = 3` example realizing exactly **nine** distinct sup-norm nearest-neighbour distances. This file
formalizes that example, giving `g_∞(3) ≥ 9`; together with the repo's `≤ 9` it shows
`g_∞(3) = 9` — the bound is attained.

## The witness (Haynes–Ramirez, §3)
`L = ℤ³`, `α = (−157/10000, −742/3125, −23/400) = (−785, −11872, −2875)/50000`, `N = 73`. The scaled
sup-norm defects `M_m = max_k |r(a_k m)|` (`a = (−785,−11872,−2875)`, balanced residues mod `50000`)
have eight records in the doubling window `(⌈73/2⌉, 73] = (37, 73]` at `m =
50,51,54,55,67,68,71,72`,
giving the nine distinct distances (over `50000`)
`11500 > 10750 > 9965 > 8912 > 8125 > 7375 > 7296 > 7088 > 7000`, realized at
`q = 24,23,22,19,18,6,5,2,1`.

Same dynamics-free, integer-exact route as `LinftyRecords.sharp_attained` (`d = 2`), extended to
three
coordinates; everything is exact modular arithmetic — no square roots.
