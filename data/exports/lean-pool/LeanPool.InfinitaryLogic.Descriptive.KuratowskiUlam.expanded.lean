# Kuratowski–Ulam: meager sections give a meager set

`isMeagre_of_isMeagre_sections`: if `A ⊆ X × Y` has the Baire property and every vertical
section `{y | (x, y) ∈ A}` is meager, then `A` is meager. This is the direction of the
Kuratowski–Ulam theorem ("Fubini for Baire category", Kechris CDST 8.41) needed for the
classical category route to Silver's theorem (step 3 of
`InfinitaryLogic/Conditional/SilverCategoryRoute.lean`; see `docs/silver-phase2-route.md`):
it makes the pullback relation on Cantor space meager once all its classes are meager.

## Proof

The auxiliary direction comes first: for a nowhere dense `F ⊆ X × Y` (with `Y` second
countable), residually many `x` have nowhere dense sections
(`residual_isNowhereDense_section`). Indeed, taking `F` closed with dense open complement
`U`, for each nonempty basic `V ⊆ Y` the set of `x` whose section of `U` meets `V` is open
(projection of an open set) and dense (density of `U` on boxes `G ×ˢ V`); on the countable
intersection over the basis, the section of `U` is dense open, so the section of `F` is
nowhere dense. Countable unions lift this to meager `M` (`residual_isMeagre_section`).

For the main theorem, write `A =ᵇ W` with `W` open (Baire property) and let `M` be the
(meager) symmetric difference. If `A` were non-meager then `W` is nonempty, so it contains
a box `G ×ˢ H`; residually many `x` have meager `M`-section, and since nonempty open sets
in the Baire space `X` are non-meager, some such `x₁` lies in `G`. Then
`H ⊆ {y | (x₁, y) ∈ A} ∪ {y | (x₁, y) ∈ M}` is meager, contradicting that `Y` is a Baire
space.
