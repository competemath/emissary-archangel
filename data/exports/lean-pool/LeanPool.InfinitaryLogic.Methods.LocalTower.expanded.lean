# The countable local Skolem tower `Llocal` / `Γlocal`

`localSkolem L Γ` (in `LocalSkolem.lean`) adjoins a Skolem function symbol only for the
formulas of a **countable** family `Γ`, and so stays countable. But one layer is not closed under
its own witness formulas, so — exactly as `skolemStage`/`skolemColim` do for the *uncountable*
full Skolemization — we iterate. Here the family `Γ` grows *in lock-step* with the language, so
the language and the family are **mutually recursive**:

* `L₀ = L`, `Γ₀` = the seed family;
* `L_{k+1} = L_k.sum (localSkolem L_k (skolemNeed Γ_k))` — adjoin Skolem symbols for the
  **Skolem-need family** `skolemNeed Γ_k = Γ_k ∪ {¬ψ | ∀ψ ∈ Γ_k}`: the EM truth lemma's `all` case
  consumes the witness symbol of the *negated body* `¬ψ` (cf. `skWitnessStep` in
  `SkolemClosure.lean` and `skWitnessTerm … ψ₀.not` in `EMTermModel.lean`), so Skolemizing `Γ_k`
  alone would miss exactly the symbol the rebased truth lemma needs;
* `Γ_{k+1}` = the subformula/component closure of a seed built from `skolemNeed Γ_k` (lifted along
  the language inclusion), the Skolem-witness bodies of the new symbols, and a reserved
  deForm-closure slot.

The mutual recursion is packaged as one `ℕ`-indexed sequence of `LocalStage` bundles
(language plus family and countability certificates), sidestepping dependent-recursion sprawl.
The **deliverable of
this chunk** is that every stage is countable — both the language's symbol types and the family
`Γ_k` — which is what keeps the eventual local colimit `L_Γ` countable (the fatal size problem that
`localSkolem` was introduced to fix). The local colimit, its cocone inclusions, and the transported
countability live in `LocalColimit.lean`; here we stop at the tower and its stagewise countability.

/-! ### The Skolem-need family: `Γ` plus the negated bodies of its universals

The EM truth lemma's `all` case for `∀ψ` uses the Skolem witness of the **negation** of the body:
`skWitnessTerm … ψ.not` (mirroring `skWitnessStep` in the full `Γ*`, which adds the witness body of
`¬ψ` for every `.all ψ`). So the successor language must carry a local Skolem symbol for `¬ψ`, not
just for the members of `Γ` themselves. `skolemNeed Γ` is the countable enlargement that provisions
exactly these symbols. -/
