# Local Geometry Step 1: Hessian Bounds via Continuity

## Normal Hessian (from Morse-Bott)
On M, D²f(m) ≥ μ in normal directions (PL ⟹ Morse-Bott).
By continuity of D²f and compactness, this extends to U₊ with constant μ'.

## Hessian lower bound
Since D²f(m) ≥ 0 for m ∈ M (minimizer) and D²f is continuous,
D²f(x) ≥ -εI on a neighborhood, with ε arbitrarily small.

Both arguments use: continuous function ≥ threshold on compact set ⟹
                     ≥ (threshold - δ) on a neighborhood.
