# Joining the odd and even extensions

This file formalizes the middle part of the proof of Lemma 2 in the paper
“A 4AP-free permutation of the positive integers”: after extending the two
parity words, put the new odd entries before the new even entries.

The suffixes `O` and `E` in the statements below are normalized: their entries
are rescaled by `x ↦ 2x+1` and `x ↦ 2x` when appended to the old word `P`.
The guard on the odd target set is exactly the paper's requirement that all
normalized odd entries below `h` have been included.

/-- **Lemma 2, construction of `Q = P O E` and its safety.**

The two recursive calls have already provided safe extensions of `P₀` and
`P₁`.  The even bound `h` determines how many odd entries must be included.
First we identify the parity restrictions of the new completion, then prove
the odd-before-even comparison displayed as equation (2) in the paper.
The final arithmetic-progression contradiction is `safe_of_parity_and_guard`.
