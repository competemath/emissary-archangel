# Globally sampled mass of an abstract multi-jump ladder

This file bounds the sum `∑_{d=1}^{r} N m (dΓ)` of the rung masses of an abstract `MultiLadder`,
sampled at the end of each block of `Γ` layers, by summing the first-passage majorant over the
blocks (`MultiLadder.sum_steps_le`).

`sum_steps_le` is a general bound on the abstract ladder. It does not identify the sampled
quantity with the components discarded by the truncation: along a truncated trajectory the mass
above the truncation rung is zero at every block boundary, where it has just been cut, even when
the discarded component is nonzero (`retained_mass_ne_discarded_norm` in
`tests/AssemblyBound.lean`).

The per-step summation of `apd:eq:total_high_weight_norm` is handled by
`Lean4LPD/Ladder/ChainBound.lean` and `Lean4LPD/Pauli/LayerError.lean`: there every block starts
from a reset state, and merging the last inflow into the chain produces the shifted slot sum
over `chain (k+1)`. The present file is the simpler, globally sampled variant, kept as a general
theorem next to `ChainBound.lean`.

## Main results

* `MultiLadder.majorant_eq_sum_range`: the outer sum of the majorant truncates at `m + 1`,
  uniformly in the number of layers.
* `MultiLadder.sum_steps_le`: the bound on the globally sampled mass.

/-- The outer sum of `majorant` truncates at `m + 1` **uniformly in `T`**, which is what lets the
sum over Trotter steps be exchanged with it. Both directions vanish: terms with `k > m` have
`chain = 0` (a path to rung `m` cannot use more than `m` jumps), and terms with `k > T` have
`C(T,k) = 0` (there are not enough layers). -/

/-- **The globally sampled abstract ladder mass over `r` blocks.**

  `∑_{d=1}^{r} N_{≥m}^{(dΓ)} ≤ ‖O‖ · ∑_{k≤m} [((r+1)Γ)^{k+1} / (Γ·(k+1)!)] · chain_k^{(m)}`.

Each ingredient is a theorem already proved rather than an estimate made here:
`MultiLadder.le_majorant` for the per-block bound, `majorant_eq_sum_range` to make the outer sum
uniform (it needs no sign hypotheses at all — both vanishings are structural), and the slot
count `Lean4LPD.sum_choose_mul_le` for the sum over blocks. `Γ` is a positive **integer**, as
appropriate for a number of layers.

The sum has the same structure as the sum over Trotter steps in the proof of
`apd:thm:one_step_truncation_error`, but with the slot count `C(dΓ, k)` of the accumulated mass
where that proof has the shifted count of the per-step inflow; see `MultiLadder.sum_block_inflow_le`
for the latter. A separate identification is needed before interpreting this abstract mass as
discarded error. -/
