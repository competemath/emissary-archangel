# The ten-word code

The construction lifts a set of polynomials of degree below `m` to one of degree below `m + 8`,
and the four coordinates `(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_∞)` attached to a lifted polynomial — its three
values at the points of `F_3` and its coefficient at the top of the new range — are constrained
to lie in a fixed ten-element code `S ⊆ F_3^4`.

The only property of `S` the construction uses is that two of its words never differ by a vector
with every coordinate in `{0, 1}`, the set of squares of `F_3`; this file records that property,
together with the three facts about squares in `F_3` it is used with. Everything here is a finite
check over `Fin 4 → ZMod 3` and `ZMod 3`, decided by the kernel.
