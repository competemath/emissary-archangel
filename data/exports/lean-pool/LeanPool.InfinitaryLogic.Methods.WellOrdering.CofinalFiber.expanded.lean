# The `ω₁` cofinal-fiber engine (issue #12, risky engine 1)

**A countable partition of `ω₁` has an unbounded fiber**: any assignment of countably many
labels to the countable ordinals takes some label unboundedly often below `ω₁`.

This is the single reusable pigeonhole behind *every* branching closure field of the
well-ordering consistency property — implication branching, positive disjunctions, and
negated conjunctions alike (audit v2, C4 engine): each `α < ω₁` chooses a branch, some branch
recurs unboundedly, and downward closure of the gap witness (`GapWitness.mono`) upgrades
"unboundedly many `α`" to "all `α`".

Proof: if every fiber were bounded, the supremum of countably many bounds would bound all of
`ω₁` — contradicting the regularity of `ℵ₁` (via `Ordinal.iSup_lt_omega_one`).
