What the paper's hypotheses are actually doing.

The paper states Theorem 13 and Lemma 7 for closed `Γ` and closed `φ`, having
assumed at the top of Section 2 that both are closed without loss of generality.
That is a perfectly good convention for a paper. Mechanization makes it worth
asking, for each hypothesis separately, whether it is doing work.

The answers are not uniform, and that is the point of this file:

* `Closed φ` is NOT needed, in Theorem 13 or in Lemma 7. Both hold for an
  arbitrary, possibly open conclusion.
* `Closed γ` for `γ ∈ Γ` IS needed in Theorem 13, and the countermodel is small.
* Localizing is NOT a convenience: replacing `Δ_Γ` by `Γ` makes Theorem 13
  false.

The third is the sharpest. `semantic_localization` says
`Γ ⊨ φ ↔ Δ_Γ ⊨loc φ`, and a reader may reasonably wonder how much distance
there is between `⊨` and `⊨loc` once `Γ` has been localized. The answer is that
the localization is exactly what closes the gap, and without it the two sides
come apart.

Statements pinned before any proof was attempted.
