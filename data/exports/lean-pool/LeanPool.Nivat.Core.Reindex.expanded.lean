# Affine lattice coordinates

Coordinate transport for Lemma 5.5 (`lem:boundary-window`) and Theorem 5.1
(`thm:twofactor`) in `paper/nivat.tex`.

A configuration and its window are transported together. The affine map `s`
acts on sites, while its additive part `t` acts on translation and period vectors.
