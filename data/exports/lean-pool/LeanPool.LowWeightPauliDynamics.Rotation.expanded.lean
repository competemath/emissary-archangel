# The rotation branching rule

This file proves `apd:eq:pauli_rotation_branch`, the elementary step of Pauli propagation, in an
arbitrary ℂ-algebra:

  `e^{i G dt/2} P e^{-i G dt/2} = P`                             if `[G,P] = 0`,
  `e^{i G dt/2} P e^{-i G dt/2} = cos(dt) P + i sin(dt) · G P`   if `{G,P} = 0`.

**This needs neither `exp` nor Pauli strings.** For any `G` with `G * G = 1` the exponential
series splits into even and odd parts and collapses to the closed form
`e^{i G θ/2} = cos(θ/2) · 1 + i sin(θ/2) · G`. Taking *that* as the definition (`rot`) reduces
the identity to algebra in a ℂ-algebra, and the file therefore sits beside `Lean4LPD.Ladder`
as a second piece of abstract, non-quantum infrastructure. The Pauli model (`Pauli/Basic.lean`,
`Pauli/Matrix.lean`, `Pauli/Branch.lean`) instantiates `A` at an operator algebra and supplies
`G * G = 1` from `G` being a *self-adjoint unitary* — Hermiticity alone would not give it — but
nothing here depends on that.

Mathlib has no "exponential of an involution" lemma — the `x² = +1` case is the missing sibling
of `Analysis/Normed/Algebra/QuaternionExponential.lean` (`q² = -‖q‖²`) and `TrivSqZeroExt`
(`ε² = 0`). `RotationExp.lean` proves that `rot` equals `NormedSpace.exp` of the generator
(`rot_eq_exp`) by splitting the exponential series, in a Hausdorff topological complex algebra;
no norm or completeness assumption is needed. This file keeps the algebraic closed form so that
its lemmas retain their purely algebraic signatures.

## Main definitions

* `rot G θ`: the closed form `cos(θ/2) · 1 + i sin(θ/2) · G` of the rotation `e^{i G θ/2}`.

## Main results

* `rot_mul_rot`: angle addition, `rot G θ₁ * rot G θ₂ = rot G (θ₁ + θ₂)`, for `G * G = 1`.
* `rot_mul_rot_neg`, `rot_neg_mul_rot`: `rot G (-θ)` is the two-sided inverse of `rot G θ`.
* `rot_conj_of_commute`: the commuting branch of `apd:eq:pauli_rotation_branch`.
* `rot_conj_of_anticommute`: the anticommuting branch.
* `rot_mem_unitary`: a rotation with a self-adjoint involutive generator is unitary.

## Conventions

The angle convention is the paper's half-angle convention (`apd:eq:pauli_rotation_branch`,
`apd:thm:local_flow_k_local`): the *conjugation angle* `dt` is primitive and the unitary is
`e^{-i G dt/2}`, so that conjugation by `e^{-i G dt/2}` rotates an anticommuting Pauli by `dt`.
A physical rotation `e^{-i α_l G_l τ}` therefore has `dt = 2 α_l τ`, and the factor `2` is
absorbed in `α := 2 max_l |α_l|`. Conjugation is in the Heisenberg picture, `U† P U` with
`U = e^{-i G dt/2}`, so the `+` exponent stands on the left and the new term is
`+i sin(dt) · G P` with the generator on the *left* of `P`. The half angle is part of the
statement, not notation: conjugation by the full-angle gate `e^{-i G dt}` would rotate by `2 dt`.

## Relation to the paper's three consequences

The paper draws three consequences from the identity: the transition is sparse in the Pauli
basis, the weight change is bounded by the locality of `G`, and the amplitude of the new term is
damped by `sin(dt)`. `rot_conj_of_anticommute` supplies the arithmetic underneath the first and
third — the image lies in `span {P, G * P}`, and the second term's coefficient is `I * sin(dt)`.
Each needs something further from the Pauli model, and it is *not the same thing*:

* *sparsity* needs a Pauli basis, with `P` and `G * P` proportional to basis elements — only
  proportional, since `Z * X = I * Y`. The span bound itself holds here unconditionally, and
  says nothing about a basis. The coefficient-level statement is `coeffVec_conj` in
  `Pauli/Flow.lean`.
* *damping* needs `P` and `G * P` linearly independent, so that the second term is a new
  transition rather than a rescaling of the first. Distinctness is not enough: `G = Z` and
  `P = E₁₀` in `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ` satisfy both hypotheses with `G * P = -P`. For Pauli
  strings linear independence is `PauliString.linearIndependent_toMatrix_mul_pair` in
  `Pauli/Matrix.lean`.

The second consequence, the weight bound, is proved in `Pauli/Weight.lean`.

## Implementation notes

Anticommutation is spelled `G * P = -(P * G)`; Mathlib has no `Anticommute` predicate. It is
`SemiconjBy G P (-P)` up to `neg_mul` — propositionally, not definitionally, since `SemiconjBy`
unfolds to `G * P = -P * G` — should that API ever be wanted. The involution hypothesis
is likewise written inline, following `Mathlib/Algebra/Star/CHSH.lean`. The Clifford-algebra
analogue of the anticommuting case is `CliffordAlgebra.ι_mul_ι_comm_of_isOrtho`, but routing
through it would cost more than the direct proof: the conjugator there is a vector, not a rotor.

/-- The rotation `e^{+ i G θ / 2}`, written in the closed form it takes when `G * G = 1`.

This is an algebraic definition. `Lean4LPD.rot_eq_exp` (in `RotationExp.lean`) proves that it
equals the exponential `NormedSpace.exp ((I * (θ / 2)) • G)` whenever `G * G = 1`, by summing
the even and odd parts of the series, and `PauliString.rot_toMatrix_eq_exp` specializes that to
Pauli matrices. Keeping the closed form here avoids adding analytic hypotheses to the algebraic
lemmas below. The paper's gate `e^{-i G dt/2}` is `rot G (-dt)`.

As a definition it is unconditional. When `G * G = 1` its two-sided inverse is `rot G (-θ)`,
and parity of `cos` and `sin` is what supplies that negative-angle expression, so no separate
inverse definition is needed. Drop the involution hypothesis and there need be no inverse at
all — `rot (0 : ℂ) π = 0`. -/

/-- **Anticommuting branch** of `apd:eq:pauli_rotation_branch`:

  `e^{i G dt/2} P e^{-i G dt/2} = cos(dt) · P + i sin(dt) · G P`.

The hypotheses are `G * G = 1` and `G * P = -(P * G)`; nothing else about `G` or `P` is used.

Two of the three consequences the paper draws from the identity (sparsity and damping) sit under
this statement in arithmetic form: the image lies in `span {P, G * P}`, and the second term's
coefficient is `I * sin θ`.

At this level of generality neither is yet the statement about Pauli coefficients, and they are
short of different things. *Sparsity* needs a Pauli basis with `P` and `G * P` proportional to
basis elements; the span bound above is unconditional and says nothing about a basis. *Damping*
needs the two linearly independent, so that `I * sin θ` is the amplitude of a new transition and
not a rescaling of `P` — and mere distinctness does not give that: with `G = Z` and `P = E₁₀` in
`Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ` both hypotheses hold and `G * P = -P`, collapsing the sum to
`(cos θ - I * sin θ) • P`.

Both are supplied for Pauli strings by `Pauli/Matrix.lean` and `Pauli/Flow.lean`, and the second
consequence, that the weight changes by at most `k_h - 1`, by `Pauli/Weight.lean`. -/
