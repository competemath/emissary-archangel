# The honest admissible fragment (issue #18)

A **purely syntactic wrapper**: an ordinary `Fragment`, closed upward under exactly the conjunctions
and disjunctions named by *certified* coded families.

Deliberately absent:

* **no `height`** — whether it belongs to the presentation or is derived is unsettled, and a field
  here would permit a fragment whose height disagreed with its presentation's;
* **no compactness data** — compactness is a theorem with hypotheses, proved externally.  That is
  what makes "a theorem named Barwise compactness merely projects a field" structurally impossible
  rather than merely observed.

This does **not** wrap the legacy `AdmissibleFragmentCore`, which an honest HF fragment provably
cannot instantiate: its `closed_iInf`/`closed_iSup` are *upward* over arbitrary external ℕ-families.

/-- **An admissible fragment**: an ordinary `Fragment`, closed *upward* under the conjunctions and
disjunctions named by **certified** coded families — and under nothing else.

Parameterized by the **family view**.  This file imports only `Admissible/Family.lean`, so the
syntax interface cannot mention theory decoding or `Sigma1`: the separation is by import, not by
convention.  A richer presentation is used here through its `toFamilyPresentation` projection. -/
