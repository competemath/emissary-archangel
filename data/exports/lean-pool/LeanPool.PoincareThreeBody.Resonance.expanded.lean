# Resonant covectors in two degrees of freedom

This file develops the elementary linear-algebra step in Poincaré's nonintegrability argument. At
a resonant action, both the unperturbed frequency and the differential of the leading coefficient
of a putative first integral annihilate the same nonzero resonance vector. In two dimensions, the
two covectors must therefore be linearly dependent.
