# Exercise 4.22 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, Lecture IV) — carving a Peano model out of a
partial one

Suppose `N*` is a structured set `⟨N*, 0, ⁺⟩` satisfying **only** axioms (i) and
(ii) of
Definition 4.5 — i.e. `0 ≠ n⁺` (zero is not a successor) and `⁺` is injective —
but *not necessarily*
the induction axiom (iii). **Must there be a subset `N ⊆ N*` that satisfies (i),
(ii), and (iii)?**

**Yes.** Following Scott's hint, take the **least fixed point in `P(N*)`**
(Exercise 4.14 / 4.13(2),
the dual Knaster–Tarski over the complete lattice `P(N*)`) of the monotone
operator

  `g(x) = {0} ∪ x⁺ = {0} ∪ {n⁺ ∣ n ∈ x}`.

This least fixed point `nats` is the smallest subset of `N*` containing `0` and
closed under `⁺`
(`zero_mem_nats`, `succ_mem_nats`). On the subtype `N = {m // m ∈ nats}`:

* (i) `0 ≠ n⁺` and (ii) `⁺` injective are **inherited** from `N*`;
* (iii) **induction** holds *by minimality* of the least fixed point: a subset of
`N` closed under
  `0`/`⁺` pulls back to a pre-fixed point of `g` in `P(N*)`, which therefore
  contains `nats`.

So `⟨N, 0, ⁺⟩` is a genuine model of Peano's Axioms (`peanoSub`), giving
`exists_peano_submodel`.

*(For set theorists.)* The existence of such an `N*` at all is guaranteed by the
**axiom of
infinity**: the standard `⟨ℕ, 0, ⁺⟩` is one (`PeanoModel ℕ`, recorded as
`natPeano`), and indeed it
already satisfies (iii), so it is its own carved-out model.

The subset `nats` is built choice-free (`lfpSet`); the `PeanoModel` packaging of
`peanoSub` and the
existence statement live over `Classical.choice` exactly as Theorem 4.6's
bijection does.
