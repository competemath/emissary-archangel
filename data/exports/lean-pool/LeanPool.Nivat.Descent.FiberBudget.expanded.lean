# Counting differences within fibers

The finite-set argument at the end of Theorem 2.2 (`thm:descent`) in
`paper/nivat.tex`. A fiber with `k` inputs needs at most `k - 1` generators for
all of its differences. `finite_fiber_budget` sums that bound over the fibers.

The argument uses an arbitrary function between sets of vectors. The application
to a Laurent filter is in `Nivat.Descent.ExactDescent`.
