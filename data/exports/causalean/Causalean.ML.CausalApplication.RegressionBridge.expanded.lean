/-! # Conditional expectations as squared-loss population targets

This file is part of the causal-application layer of `Causalean.ML`: files under
`Causalean/ML/CausalApplication/` may import causal and estimation modules, while the
`Causalean/ML/` core remains causal-free.

The ML population-target keystone
(`square_loss_population_target_of_isResidualOrthogonal`) is stated for a function whose
residual is orthogonal to every function of the covariate (`IsResidualOrthogonal`).
Here we connect that to Mathlib's `condExp`: the conditional mean `E[Y ∣ X]` is
characterized by that moment condition under the stated integrability assumptions. With the
additional finite-risk and cross-term assumptions in the population-target theorem, this
condition can be used to establish squared-loss risk comparisons.
