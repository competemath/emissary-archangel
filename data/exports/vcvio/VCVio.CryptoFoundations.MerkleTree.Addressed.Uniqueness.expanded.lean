# Queried-domain uniqueness for addressed Merkle openings

This module adds a finite-transcript alternative to global injectivity of a compressing hash:
injectivity on the finite query
transcript that covers the two openings being compared.  Query identity includes the full typed
oracle address/key and the ordered child pair. Thus the result has the shape consumed by an
address-aware random-oracle or collision-resistance argument.

`openingQueries` enumerates exactly the node-hash inputs induced by one leaf opening.
`NodeHashInjectiveOnQueries` asks for injectivity only among entries of a supplied list. If two
complete
openings are covered by that list and recompute the same root, `opening_unique_of_queryInjectiveOn`
proves equality of both the leaf value and authentication path.

The theorem applies to single addressed openings; batch-opening uniqueness is developed in the
batch modules.
