# One-round regression for round-by-round knowledge extraction

This smoke test instantiates a genuinely nontrivial one-round `KnowledgeExtractionFamily` over a
uniformly sampled two-challenge round and exercises the strict-trigger content of Definition 3.12
of Block, Garreta, Tiwari, and Zając (*On Soundness Notions for Interactive Oracle Proofs*,
Cryptology ePrint Archive 2023/1256), rather than merely naming the generic bridge.

The instantiated family is deliberately non-vacuous:

* the canonical initial context is doomed for every input (`oneRound_initialCondition`);
* a doomed terminal context forces rejection (`oneRound_terminalCondition`);
* the extracted witness genuinely fails the relation (`oneRound_relation_fails`);
* the fresh challenge escapes the doomed set with probability exactly `1 / 2`
  (`oneRound_escape_prob`), so escape has nonzero probability;
* on the doomed `(context, message)` subtype the transition `badEvent` reduces to that escape event
  (`oneRound_badEvent_iff`);
* at `error = Pr[escape] = 1 / 2` the strict trigger `error < Pr[escape]` does **not** fire, and
  both sides of the bridge hold (`oneRound_extractionCondition_half`, `oneRound_isBounded_half`);
* at the strictly smaller `error = 0` the strict trigger fires on a failed extraction, so both the
  extraction condition and boundedness fail (`oneRound_not_extractionCondition_zero`,
  `oneRound_not_isBounded_zero`).

At least one theorem (`oneRound_escape_prob`) establishes the concrete probability fact directly
instead of restating `KnowledgeExtractionFamily.extractionCondition_iff_isBounded` by application.
The final `oneRound_extractionCondition_iff_isBounded` still exercises the generic bridge on this
concrete family.

One caveat about the family above, and the reason for the companion below. `ExtractionCondition`
is a conditional, and for `oneRound` its antecedent `error < Pr[escape]` is unsatisfiable at
`1 / 2`, since escape has probability exactly `1 / 2`. So `oneRound_extractionCondition_half` is
vacuously true: axiom-clean while asserting nothing about extraction. This is the failure class in
`docs/agents/gotchas.md` §14, and `#print axioms` cannot detect it.

`oneRoundValid` supplies the missing certificate. It differs from `oneRound` only in its relation,
so that `extract`'s output satisfies it, and then:

* `oneRoundValid_hypotheses_satisfiable` exhibits a context that is doomed **and** whose escape
  probability exceeds the error, so the clause's antecedents are jointly inhabitable;
* `oneRoundValid_extractionCondition_zero` discharges the clause at `error = 0` *because
  extraction succeeds*, with the trigger firing rather than silent;
* `oneRoundValid_isBounded_zero` reaches the relation-holds branch of the generic bridge, which
  `oneRound` cannot;
* `oneRoundValid_extensionalConditions` bundles all three clauses at `error = 0`, since showing
  each hypothesis separately inhabited is weaker than a witness for the whole bundle.

The context type at each stage is `Fin 2` (carrying the sampled challenge at the terminal stage),
