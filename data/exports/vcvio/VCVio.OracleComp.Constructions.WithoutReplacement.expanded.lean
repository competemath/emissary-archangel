# Drawing without replacement until enough successes

`drawUntil accept r pool` draws uniformly from `pool` without replacement and stops as soon as `r`
accepting values have been collected, or when the pool runs out. It returns the values drawn, in
order, so a caller can read off both how many draws it made and which of them accepted.

`expectedValue_length_drawUntil` identifies its expected number of draws with the negative
hypergeometric recursion `NegHypergeom.expectedDraws`, and `expectedValue_length_drawUntil_le`
gives the resulting closed-form bound. Exhaustion needs no separate treatment: the loop simply
returns the whole pool, and `NegHypergeom.expectedDraws_le` already covers that case.

The pool is a `List`, not a `Finset`, because a draw is an index rather than a value: that keeps
the loop in `ProbComp` with no failure branch, makes the recursion terminate on the pool's length,
and costs nothing, since positions are what the counting argument uses anyway. Duplicates in the
pool are allowed and are counted as distinct.

The draw count is read as the expected length of the returned list, through
`OracleComp.EvalDist.expectedValue`.
