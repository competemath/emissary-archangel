# Reduction of Batch Openings to Single-Index Openings

This file constructs, for every leaf selected by a batch opening, a *single-index*
authentication path whose putative root (in the sense of `getPutativeRootWithHash`) equals
the batch opening's putative root. The construction reads the sibling hash at each level
either directly off the batch proof (when the sibling subtree is pruned) or by recomputing
the sibling's putative subroot from the batch data (when the sibling subtree contains
selected leaves).

This is the deterministic kernel for transferring the single-index security results to batch
openings:

* **Binding transfers now.** `getPutativeBatchRootWithHash_binding` shows that two batch
  openings — under *possibly different selectors* — that both select some leaf index, claim
  distinct values there, and produce the same putative root, yield a concrete hash collision
  via the constructive `findCollision` kernel of `Binding.lean`. (Note this is strictly more
  general than the same-selector uniqueness of `BatchUniqueness.lean`, which needs an
  injective hash; here the hash is arbitrary and the output is a collision as data.)
* **A deterministic kernel for a future extractability transfer.** This file does *not*
  prove batch extractability. What it provides is the deterministic core such a proof will
  consume: `batchToSingleProof` maps any verifying batch opening, at any *selected* leaf, to
  a single-index opening for that leaf recomputing the very same putative root
  (`getPutativeRootWithHash_batchToSingleProof`). The game-level transfer remains future
  work and still has to: package the adversary's *dynamic* choice of selector, preserve the
  commitment-phase extraction log across the reduction, account for the root-recomputation
  query costs, and transfer the winning event itself.

## Main definitions

* `InductiveMerkleTree.selectedValueAt`: the claimed value of a batch opening at a selected
  leaf index.
* `InductiveMerkleTree.batchToSingleProof`: the single-index authentication path extracted
  from a batch opening at a selected leaf index.

## Main results

* `getPutativeRootWithHash_batchToSingleProof` — the extracted single-index opening
  recomputes exactly the batch putative root.
* `getPutativeBatchRootWithHash_binding` — cross-selector batch binding, with the collision
  exhibited by `findCollision`.

Extract a single-index authentication path from a batch opening at a selected leaf index.
At each level, the sibling hash is either stored in the batch proof (pruned sibling) or
recomputed as the sibling's putative batch subroot (sibling with selected leaves).

**Root preservation.** The single-index opening extracted from a batch opening at any
selected leaf recomputes exactly the batch opening's putative root. Consequently a batch
opening that verifies against a root yields, at every selected leaf, a single-index opening
that verifies against the same root.

**Cross-selector batch binding.** Two batch openings — under possibly *different* selectors
that both select the leaf index `idx` — which claim distinct values at `idx` yet produce the
same putative root, yield a concrete hash collision, exhibited by the constructive
`findCollision` kernel applied to the two extracted single-index openings.

This strengthens `BatchUniqueness.getPutativeBatchRootWithHash_unique` in two directions:
the two selectors need not be equal, and the hash function is arbitrary (the conclusion is a
collision as data rather than an agreement under an injectivity hypothesis).
