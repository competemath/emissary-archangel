# Batch Openings for Inductive Merkle Trees

This file defines *batch* openings for the inductive Merkle tree construction of
`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.MerkleTree.Inductive.Defs`: opening several leaves of one tree
against a single root with a single, deduplicated piece of authentication data.

A batch opening is specified by a *selector* `sel : LeafData Bool s` marking which leaves
are opened. The authentication data `BatchProof α sel` mirrors the shape of the tree, but is
*pruned*: a subtree containing no selected leaf contributes exactly one hash (its root) to
the proof, and the proof does not descend into it. In particular:

* opening a single leaf recovers (the information content of) the single-index
  `generateProof` copath;
* opening *all* leaves yields a proof carrying **no** hashes at all (the verifier recomputes
  everything from the claimed leaf values);
* shared copath nodes between the opened leaves are never duplicated.

This is the vector-commitment operation used by the query phase of IOP-based proof systems
(FRI/STIR/WHIR) and by the BCS transform, where a verifier opens many leaves of one
committed vector at once.

## Relation to path pruning in the SNARGs book

This is an intrinsic encoding of the *path-pruning* optimization in
[*Building Cryptographic Proofs from Hash Functions*](https://snargsbook.org/). The book
first presents a multi-opening as one authentication path per opened location, then removes
both duplicate commitments and commitments derivable from the opened leaves. Its optimized
proof contains the minimal authentication frontier: the vertices in the union of the
copaths, minus the vertices in the union of the paths.

`BatchProof` represents that same frontier directly for an arbitrary indexed binary-tree
skeleton. An unselected subtree contributes exactly its root, while a subtree containing
selected leaves is recomputed from its selected values and recursively pruned proof. The
dependent constructors make the pruned shape canonical instead of representing the
frontier as a separate flat vertex set. `batchToSingleProof` in `Batch.ToSingle` is the
corresponding expansion into an authentication path for one selected leaf. A separate
tuple-of-paths compression API and a full compression/expansion equivalence are not
formalized here.

## Main definitions

* `InductiveMerkleTree.BatchProof`: pruned authentication data for a selector. The family is
  indexed by the selector, so structurally malformed proofs (extra hashes, hashes for opened
  subtrees, or descent into pruned subtrees) are unrepresentable. It is inhabited only when
  the selector selects at least one leaf.
* `InductiveMerkleTree.SelectedValues`: the tuple of claimed values for the selected leaves.
* `InductiveMerkleTree.selectedValues`: extract the selected values from leaf data.
* `InductiveMerkleTree.generateBatchProof`: the honest prover, reading pruned subtree roots
  off the cached full tree.
* `InductiveMerkleTree.getPutativeBatchRoot(WithHash)`: recompute the root from claimed
  values plus batch proof (monadic and functional forms), with the `simulateQ` reduction
  lemma connecting them.
* `InductiveMerkleTree.verifyBatchProof`: compare the putative root against a claimed root.

Completeness is proved in `VCVio.CryptoFoundations.MerkleTree.Inductive.Batch.Completeness`,
and opening uniqueness under an injective hash in
`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.MerkleTree.Inductive.Batch.Uniqueness`.

**Tracked follow-up (sparse selectors).** The dense selector `LeafData Bool s` is the
right internal representation for the recursions here, but downstream consumers
(FRI/STIR/WHIR-style query patterns in ArkLib) naturally hold a sparse `List`/`Finset` of
query indices. A conversion API (sparse index set → dense selector, with `getLeaf`-level
correspondence lemmas) should be added before those consumers land, so they neither pay
for nor expose a full-tree selection mask.

Authentication data for a batch opening with selector `sel`.

The proof mirrors the tree's shape but is *pruned at unselected subtrees*: whenever one
child of an internal node contains no selected leaf, the proof stores that child's root
hash and descends only into the other child. When both children contain selected leaves,
the proof stores no hash at that node and descends into both. At a selected leaf the proof
stores nothing (the verifier is given the claimed leaf value separately, via
`SelectedValues`).

The hypotheses on the pruning constructors make the proof shape canonical for its selector:
for every selector that selects at least one leaf exactly one constructor applies at each
node. Conversely the family is *uninhabited* whenever `sel.anySelected = false` (see
`BatchProof.anySelected_of_batchProof` below): there is no such thing as a
batch proof that opens nothing.
