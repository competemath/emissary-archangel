# Sequential Composition of Stateful Merkle Phases

This module composes the one-phase predictable-target theorem across a fixed number of commitment
rounds. One global query bound covers a proof-only runner that mirrors the commitment phases and
ends in a log-dependent accounting computation.

The commitment prefix is identical to `runCommitmentsThen`. At every boundary, the accumulated

query budget used by the stopping theorem. -/
