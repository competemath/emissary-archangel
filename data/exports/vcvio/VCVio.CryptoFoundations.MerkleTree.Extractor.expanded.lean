# Generic transcript extractor for Merkle trees

This module owns the shared extraction recurrence for both unaddressed and addressed Merkle
trees. `QueryView` explains how an oracle query exposes an address key and an ordered pair of
children. `treeAt` reconstructs a partial tree by looking up the first logged query with the
expected address and response, threading the caller's map from typed tree positions to actual
oracle keys.

The unaddressed extractor specializes `Address := Unit`; an addressed extractor supplies its
actual oracle address type. Consequently these are two views of one algorithm, not parallel
implementations. A non-injective position-to-address map is allowed and faithfully models
concrete address encodings that alias.
