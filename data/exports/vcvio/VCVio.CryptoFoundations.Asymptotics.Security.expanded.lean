# Asymptotic Security Experiments and Games

This file defines asymptotic security experiments and games where the advantage function
is abstract — not tied to any specific game formulation. This allows the same meta-theorems
(reductions, game-hopping, hybrid arguments) to work for failure-based games (`SecExp`),
distinguishing games (`ProbComp.distAdvantage`), and any other advantage metric.

## Main Definitions

- `SecurityExp`: An advantage function `ℕ → ℝ≥0∞` with security = negligibility.
- `SecurityGame Adv`: An advantage function `Adv → ℕ → ℝ≥0∞` with quantified security.
- Smart constructors: `ofSecExp`, `ofDistGame`, `ofGuessGame`.

## Main Results

- `SecurityExp.secure_of_pointwise_bound`: Pointwise ≤ negligible ⟹ secure.
- `SecurityGame.secureAgainst_of_reduction`: Basic security reduction (tight).
- `SecurityGame.secureAgainst_of_poly_reduction`: Polynomial-loss security reduction.
- `SecurityGame.secureAgainst_of_close`: Game-hopping step.
- `SecurityGame.secureAgainst_of_hybrid`: Hybrid argument over a chain of games.

/-! ## Asymptotic Security Games

A security game is parameterized by an adversary type. The advantage function maps
each adversary and security parameter to a non-negative extended real.

The predicate `isPPT` is left abstract; users specialize it to `PolyQueries` or other
efficiency notions as appropriate. -/
