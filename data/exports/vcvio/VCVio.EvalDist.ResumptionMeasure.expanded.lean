# Measure semantics of resumptions

PolyFun's `PFunctor.Resumption` represents computations that may expose infinitely many visible
queries and never return. The primitive denotational observations here follow its existing
`Resumption.truncate` surface:

* `truncateMeasure k computation` is a probability measure on `Option β`; `none` records that the
  computation did not return within `k` visible queries;
* `outputMeasure k computation` discards the `none` mass and is therefore a subprobability measure
  on returned values;
* `returnedMeasure computation` is the monotone supremum of those finite observations and records
  divergence as missing mass.

The total truncation and returned-output views are deliberately separate. A nonterminating
computation is not a failed ordinary result, and an infinite trace distribution is not determined
by pretending an arbitrary Lean continuation is measurable. A future infinite-trace semantics
should be constructed from a measurable coalgebra using Mathlib kernels and Ionescu--Tulcea; the
finite marginals here are the observable compatibility boundary such a construction must extend.
