# Sequential Merkle commitment phases

This module runs an adaptive sequence of Merkle commitment phases while recording one extractor
checkpoint after every emitted root.  Each phase receives the previous phase's private state, may
make homogeneous oracle queries, and selects its next configuration tag adaptively.

`runCommitments` is itself one `OracleComp`.  Calling `withQueryLog` around each phase records only
that phase's query segment; it does not evaluate the phase or install a fresh oracle.  A later game
can therefore interpret the complete runner through one caching random-oracle implementation and
obtain the shared-ROM semantics required by multi-extractability.

This layer deliberately stops before the terminal opening phase.  The opening verifier determines
what auxiliary state and dependent opening claims it needs, and owns the accepted/rejected bit.
Likewise, no query bound or probability statement is attached to this executable runner.
