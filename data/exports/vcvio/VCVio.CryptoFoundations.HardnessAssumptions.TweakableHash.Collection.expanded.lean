# The collection oracle for the single-function, distinct-tweak, multi-target games

A reduction attacking one member of a tweakable-hash family must still evaluate members of that
family to simulate the rest of the structure — SLH-DSA's `F`, `H` and `T_ℓ` share one public seed
and one address space — and cannot do so once the seed is withheld from it. This oracle is that
access.

Which members it covers is fixed at instantiation, not here. `TweakableHashCollection.cons` puts the
attacked member in the collection, so this oracle also evaluates it at tweaks that are not targets;
that case is HK22's `Th_m ∈ Th_λ`, and a reduction against SLH-DSA needs it, since only a handful of
the addresses at which `F` runs are targets.

The collection is a parameter of each problem rather than a second game beside it. The stand-alone
notion is the instance at the empty collection (`TweakableHashCollection.empty`), where the query
type is uninhabited — pinned by `isEmpty_domain_collectionSpec_empty`; the games' `standalone`
constructors package that instantiation.

Module names in this directory follow from that. Their base name identifies the *property* rather
than distinguishing its stand-alone and collection-indexed instances: since the latter subsumes the
former, there is no separate collection module and no `…C` suffix, unlike the EasyCrypt development
this family is transcribed from. Where both validity presentations exist, the `FinalValidity` suffix
marks the sticky monitor (`TweakableHash.SourceFinalValidity`); an unsuffixed name denotes the
rejection-on-arrival game defined here.

The target/challenge tweaks must be distinct from each other and from every tweak submitted to the
collection oracle. This API enforces that discipline in the oracles: the collection oracle rejects
any tweak already in the challenge history, and each game's challenge oracle rejects a tweak already
in its own or the collection oracle's history. This follows DKKW's rejection-on-arrival presentation
and extends it across the collection boundary. BDHMS instead records every query and checks its
`VQS_t` predicate only in the final winning condition; that is a distinct adaptive experiment, not a
definitional presentation of this one, rendered by `TweakableHash.SourceFinalValidity`. The two
presentations have distinct adversary types, so neither admits the other's adversaries directly.
`TweakableHash.ToFinalValidity` instead supplies, per game, an explicit conversion sending an
adversary here to one against the corresponding source-final-validity game at exactly the same
advantage; `TweakableHash.SM_DT_TCR_advantage_toSourceFinalValidity` is the SM-DT-TCR member.

/-! ## The tweak discipline

Both oracles test a queried tweak against the two histories, and the predicates below are that test.
`Q` is the type of one recorded challenge query and `tweakOf` reads its tweak, so neither predicate
— nor `collectionOracle`, which uses the first of them — fixes the rest of a query's shape. SM-TCR
records `Tweak × M` and SM-PRE records `Tweak × M'`, both at `tweakOf := Prod.fst`; a game whose
history is tweaks alone takes `Q := Tweak` and `tweakOf := id`. -/

/-- The collection oracle at a public seed, over the two-part game state
`(challenge history, collection tweaks)`.

A query is rejected with `none` exactly when its tweak is reserved by the challenge oracle; the
state is then untouched. Otherwise the answer is the queried member evaluated at the game's seed,
and the tweak is appended to the collection tweak list. Repeated collection tweaks are accepted.

The challenge history is a list of `Q`, read only through `tweakOf`, so a game records whatever its
winning condition needs — `Tweak × M` for SM-TCR, `Tweak × M'` for SM-PRE, `Tweak` alone for a game
that needs no payload — and this oracle is unchanged by the choice. -/
