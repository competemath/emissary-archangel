# Online Evolution of Merkle Extraction

The central causal bridge for multi-extractability is local: if appending one fresh query/response
entry changes extraction of an already recorded root, then the new response was already a live
target immediately before it was sampled. This module proves that statement directly from the
extractor's first-matching-entry semantics.
