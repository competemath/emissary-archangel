# Round-indexed event games

This module packages a family of probabilistic events indexed by rounds, with a potentially
different type of execution context at each round. Each event is exposed as a failure-based
`SecExp`, and `experiment_advantage` identifies its advantage with the probability of that event.
`IsBounded` states a separate error bound for each round.

`KnowledgeTransitionFamily` specializes this interface to the event that a fresh challenge changes
a knowledge-state predicate from false to true. This layer does not impose protocol-specific laws or
computational restrictions; those and any admissibility conditions belong in downstream adapters.

`KnowledgeExtractionFamily` gives the extensional clauses of generalized round-by-round knowledge
from Block, Garreta, Tiwari, and Zając, *On Soundness Notions for Interactive Oracle Proofs*
(Cryptology ePrint Archive 2023/1256), generalized RBR knowledge, Definition 3.12. The protocol
model is strictly alternating: at every interaction round the prover sends one message and the
verifier then samples one fresh uniform challenge, so a partial transcript is
`(m₁, c₁, …, m_i, c_i)`. Schedules that are not message/challenge alternating (for example two
consecutive prover messages, or a challenge-first round) are represented in this model by padding
the appropriate message or challenge type with `Unit`; this is a faithful encoding, not a claim
that arbitrary scheduling has been added. Its transcript context and prover message are fixed
before sampling a fresh uniform challenge. The API records the all-inputs initial doomed condition
and the terminal doomed-implies-rejection condition separately from the strict extraction
condition.

This layer is **extensional**: `extract` is data returning a candidate witness and
`ExtractionCondition` only asserts that this witness is valid whenever the strict escape trigger
`error < Pr[escape]` fires. It is therefore the soundness-strength/existence content of Definition
3.12, **not** the paper's full computational round-by-round knowledge claim; it carries no security
parameter, encoding, runtime bound, or polynomial-time predicate on the extractor.

TODO: the deferred computational layer needs a security-indexed family of encoded polynomial-time
extractors together with negligible per-round error, and lives behind the separate polytime
framework. This module deliberately does not add that layer or depend on an unmerged branch.

/-- The extensional extraction clause with a separate error for each round.

For every fixed context and prover message whose preceding state is doomed, an escape probability
strictly greater than the round's error requires the directly extracted witness to be valid.

The prover message is quantified **outside** the escape hypothesis, so each message carries its own
extraction obligation. Definition 3.12 instead writes "for all `m ∈ M_i` we have
`Pr[(x, τ, m, c) ∉ D] > ε_i`, then `Ext(x, τ, m)` outputs a witness", placing the quantifier inside
the hypothesis; read literally that is `(∀ m, P m) → (∀ m, Q m)`, which this clause **strictly
strengthens**. The per-message reading is the one the source itself uses: the same clause names the
specific transcript `(x, τ, m)` an *RBR extractable partial transcript*, which carries no
information under the literal reading, and the proof of Theorem 1.2 concludes that
`(x, τ, EndNode(τ))` is extractable from that one message's escape probability. The literal `∀ m`
appears to be carried over from Definition 3.11's soundness clause, where it belongs to the
conclusion rather than the hypothesis.
