# The three sizes of the Bit Sum Lemma, and that they fit

`DescriptiveComplexity.TimesBitDef` – multiplication of ranks in the bit logic,
the last step between the machine model and AC⁰ – rests on counting the
ones of a `P`-bit word, `P` being the number of bit positions
(`DescriptiveComplexity.posCount`). The count is done in three nested packings,
and each of them has to *fit in one element*, that is, below the place value
`2 ^ (P - 1)`, which is the only size a universe is guaranteed to have room for.
This file fixes the three sizes and proves that they fit, with no formula and no
structure in sight: it is the arithmetic that decides whether the packings of
the Bit Sum Lemma exist at all.

## The sizes

* **Level 1** cuts the `P` positions into blocks of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.lvl1Block` positions and keeps, in each block,
  the number of ones below it – a number `≤ P`, so a field of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.lvl1Width` bits
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.lt_two_pow_lvl1Width`). The block is *twice*
  the field, so the packing occupies half the tape and its top bit stays below
  the top position.
* **Level 2** does the same one size down, inside a single block: sub-blocks of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.lvl2Block` positions, with a field of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.lvl2Width` bits holding a number `≤ lvl1Block`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.lvl1Block_lt_two_pow_lvl2Width`).
* **Level 3** counts the ones of one sub-block by a *table indexed by its
  value*: `lvl2Block + 1` sections of `2 ^ lvl2Block` bits each. That the table
  fits is `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.table_lt`, and it is the inequality the
  whole design turns on.

## Why two levels cannot do it

Level 1 needs its field to hold `P`, so `2 ^ lvl1Block > P`; a table indexed by
the value of a level-1 block would need `(lvl1Block + 1) · 2 ^ lvl1Block < P`.
The two are contradictory, which is the arithmetic form of the packing
obstruction: a level's items and its fields are paired by
co-location, and a level whose fields are wider than the gap between its items
cannot be co-located. Three levels are compatible because the table is indexed
by a *sub*-block, whose value is quadratic in `lvl1Width` and so far below `P`.

## The threshold

Everything holds once `2 ^ 20 ≤ P`, which is
`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.le_posCount_of_card` in terms of the universe: a
universe with more than `2 ^ (2 ^ 20 - 1)` elements. The bound is crude on
purpose – it is discharged once and for all by
`DescriptiveComplexity.BitDef.of_large` (`LogTime/Small.lean`), which turns a
statement about the large universes into a statement about all of them, so
nothing downstream carries it.
