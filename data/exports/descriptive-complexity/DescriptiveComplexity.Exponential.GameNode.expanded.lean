# The nodes of an interpreted AND/OR graph, as states of a game

The road from `DescriptiveComplexity.EXPTIME` to `SO-GAME` reads a `PTIME` inner
problem as the **AND/OR graph an interpretation draws on the expanded
universe**, and plays that graph. A node of the graph is a
tagged tuple of points, so a node is a *state* of a second-order game – that
correspondence is what this file builds.

Two things are settled here.

**The interpretation may be taken non-relativized.** `GAME` is PTIME-hard under
ordinary ordered reductions (`DescriptiveComplexity.game_hard_ordered`): the
composite of the Horn discharge with the unit-propagation game is a plain
`≤ᶠᵒ[≤]`, and `DescriptiveComplexity.game_PTIME_hard` only widens it to `≤ʳᶠᵒ[≤]`
at the very end. That matters here: a *definable domain* would have to be
checked by a formula over the expansion, i.e., by a whole sub-game, whereas a
non-relativized interpretation leaves the nodes guarded by nothing but “each
slot is a point”.

**A node is a guarded assignment.** The state block is
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.nodeBlock`: the `d` rounds of
`DescriptiveComplexity.repMerged`, each holding one point of the expanded
universe (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.pointBlock`), extended by tag bits
for the interpretation's tag. `DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.nodeGuardF`
says exactly that a guessed state is such a tuple
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.realize_nodeGuardF`), so quantifying over
nodes of the graph is quantifying over guarded states
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.exists_node_iff`).
