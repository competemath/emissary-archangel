# The states of the graph game

The game that carries `DescriptiveComplexity.EXPTIME` to SO-GAME has one
block for everything: `n`
rounds of the point block (`DescriptiveComplexity.repMerged`) extended by tag
bits naming a **phase**. This file fixes the phases and says what a state is.

## The phases

`DescriptiveComplexity.Ph` has six families, and the whole design of the game is
in the table:

| phase | owner | what its moves are |
|---|---|---|
| `startPick tx` | ∀ | prove `AGStart x`; and play from `x` |
| `main tx` | ∃ | claim `AGWon x`; or claim `x` is existential; or claim it is universal |
| `exStep tx ty` | ∀ | prove `¬AGUniv x`; prove `AGMove x y`; and win from `y` |
| `allCert tx ty` | ∀ | prove `AGUniv x`; prove `AGMove x y`; and answer every `y'` |
| `allStep tx ty` | ∃ | refute `AGMove x y`; or win from `y` |
| `pre s tx ty j pol` | `pol` | fill round `n - j`, or – at `j = 0` – be decided by the kernel |

Two of the six families are there for reasons that are easy to get wrong and
expensive to discover late.

* **`allCert` certifies a successor before the universal player moves.**
  `DescriptiveComplexity.WinsOn.all` requires a universal position to *have* a
  legal move, so a universal node with none loses; without the witness the
  simulation would let the existential player win there by refuting every
  proposed move. The convention that a stuck universal position loses is paid
  for here, once.
* **`allStep` is existential and may refute.** The universal player proposes an
  arbitrary tagged tuple of points, legal or not; the existential player escapes
  an illegal proposal by proving `¬AGMove x y` rather than by the move being
  filtered out, which no sentence over the base could do.

The claim phases (`exStep`, `allCert`) are universal with the *proof* and the
*play* as sibling moves: claiming falsely loses on the proof branch, so the
existential player is forced to tell the truth about `AGUniv x`.

## The states

A state is `DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.stateAssign`: a phase and one
assignment per round. Rounds are *not* guarded to be points in general – the play
rounds of a prefix range over all assignments, the guards living inside the
kernel (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.stepF`) – but the rounds of every
node-carrying phase are, which is what
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.allRoundsPointF` asserts at the start and
every node move preserves.
