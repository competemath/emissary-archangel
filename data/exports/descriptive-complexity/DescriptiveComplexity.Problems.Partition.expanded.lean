# Partition

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.Partition`, Karp's PARTITION – can a
family of numbers, written in *binary*, be split into two parts of equal sum?

It collects the definition, its isomorphism-invariance, the membership half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.partition_mem_NP`) – the certificate guesses the split and two
ripple-carry walks, one along the chosen items, one along the others, on the
*wide* positions of `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.Wide`, and requires them to agree
at the last item, which says exactly that the two sides weigh the same – and
the hardness half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.naeSat_ordered_fo_reduction_partition`), a reduction from
NAE-SAT by digit blocks: one per variable, forcing an assignment, and one per
clause, forcing between one and `w − 1` true literals out of `w`.

Karp's own reduction pads a Knapsack instance with the weights `2Σ − T` and
`Σ + T`; both are arithmetic in the total, hence not first-order definable, so
hardness has to start from NAE-SAT instead.
