# A guessing program, deterministic after its guess

A reduction into `DescriptiveComplexity.WideAccept` has to read its certificate
off an **arbitrary** accepting run, so the program cannot be deterministic: its
guessing phase is exactly the place where two runs part. What makes the reading
survivable is that it parts there and nowhere else, and the notion that says so
is `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.UniqueFrom` – every configuration reachable from
a given one has at most one successor – which all the read-off lemmas of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.DetRun` are stated at.

This file joins the two halves. `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Table.SepOn` is the
program's obligation, discharged rule by rule as
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Table.Sep` is; `hclosed` says the phases it separates
at are never left; and the conclusion is uniqueness from any configuration whose
state has one of those phases. Global determinism is the case `Ph = fun _ => True`,
where `hclosed` is free.

/-- **A program that separates at the phases it can reach is unique from
there.** The invariant is “the state's phase satisfies `Ph`”: a rule fired from
such a phase lands in one again by `hclosed`, and at such a state the transition
is pinned by `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Table.tr_unique_of_sepOn`. This is what a
*guessing* program has in place of determinism. -/
