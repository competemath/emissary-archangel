# Alternating machine acceptance in bounded space, as a decision problem

EXPTIME's complete problem: an alternating Turing machine is *data in an
instance*, and

> does this machine accept its input, with the tape indexed by the positions and
> no bound whatever on the length of a play?

is `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMAcceptSpace`, an ordinary iso-invariant problem of
the catalog. It stands to `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMAccept` exactly as
`DescriptiveComplexity.DTMAcceptSpace` stands to
`DescriptiveComplexity.DTMAccept`: the step bound is dropped and the space stays
bounded by construction.

Two differences from the polynomial-hierarchy problem, both of them
*relaxations*:

* the vocabulary is `FirstOrder.Language.turingAlt 2` – two marks, one per
  player – and the promise folded into the yes-instances is only that they
  **split** the states (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlocksSplit`), not
  `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlocksWellFormed`, whose ordering clause is
  what bounds the number of alternations. Here the alternation is unbounded,
  which is the whole point;
* acceptance is `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAcceptsSpace`, the least fixed
  point of the game operator rather than a budgeted recursion.

Isomorphism-invariance is proved from the *two* agreements an isomorphism
supplies – one per direction – so that only the forward transport lemmas of
`DescriptiveComplexity.MachinesAltSpace` are needed and no finiteness is
assumed.
