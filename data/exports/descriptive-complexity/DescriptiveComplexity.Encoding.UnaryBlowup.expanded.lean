# The size bounds have teeth: unary encodings are rejected

A criterion nobody can fail is worth nothing. This file proves that the
`card_le` bound of `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding` genuinely rejects the one
mistake the choice of number encoding (`DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers`) can
lead to: encoding a number in *unary* – as the cardinality of a marked set –
when the honest size of the instance counts its *bit length*. Under a unary
encoding a subset-sum instance sits on a universe exponential in its own size,
and the NP-hardness of the weighted problems of the catalog (Knapsack,
Partition, Job Sequencing, 0-1 Integer Programming) would silently evaporate.

* `DescriptiveComplexity.no_unary_encoding`: there is **no** encoding of
  subset-sum instances, sized by bit length, whose universe holds one element
  per unit of weight. The witness family is `([2 ^ k], 2 ^ k)`, of size
  `Θ(k)`: a unary universe on it is exponential in the declared size, so
  `card_le` cannot be discharged.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.binarySubsetSumEncoding`, in
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.BinarySubsetSum`, is the positive contrast:
  the honest *binary* encoding of the same instance type
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.Binary`: items and bit positions, a `bit`
  relation) satisfies both bounds with room to spare, and is faithful for
  Knapsack.

Together they turn the prose lesson of `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers` – unary
versus binary genuinely changes the problem – into a theorem.

This file is deliberately off the library's core import path: the negative
result needs a little asymptotics (`Mathlib.Analysis.SpecificLimits.Normed`),
which the core does not otherwise pull in.
