# 3-colorability is NP-complete

Umbrella file for the problem 3COL (`DescriptiveComplexity.ThreeCol`, defined in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.ThreeColorability.Defs`), collecting its two
first-order reductions –

* `DescriptiveComplexity.threeCol_fo_reduction_sat : ThreeCol ≤ᶠᵒ SAT` (order-free,
  quantifier-free; `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.ThreeColorability.ToSat`), and
* `DescriptiveComplexity.sat_ordered_fo_reduction_threeCol : SAT ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] ThreeCol`
  (ordered; `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.ThreeColorability.FromSat`) –

and deriving its NP-completeness from the Cook–Levin theorem
([Cook 1971][cook1971complexity]; [Levin 1973][levin1973universal];
`DescriptiveComplexity.SAT_NP_complete`), with no machine model anywhere. As with any
complexity-theoretic statement, these results are about finite graphs only
(`ComplexityClass.mem_congr_finite`/`hard_congr_finite`).
