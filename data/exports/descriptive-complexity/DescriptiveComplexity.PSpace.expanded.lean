# PSPACE, by second-order transitive closure

**The class PSPACE**: the problems definable in SO(TC), second-order logic with
a transitive closure taken over assignments of a relation block
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCDefinable`), which captures polynomial space on ordered
structures ([Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive], ch. 10). This is the same
move as defining `PTIME` by the Horn fragment, `NL` by the Krom fragment and
`NP` by `Σ₁`-definability: the class is a *definition*, not an axiom, and it is
a bona fide `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass` because SO(TC) definability is
closed under (ordered) first-order reductions – the block and the three
sentences all survive the pullback, see
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderTransitiveClosurePull`.

## Why the states are relations

An SO(TC) walk remembers an assignment of relations, i.e., `n^a` bits on a
universe of size `n`, and may take exponentially many steps to reach its
target. That is precisely a polynomially space-bounded computation: the
configuration is the remembered assignment, and the (first-order) transition
sentence is one step of the machine. Immerman's capture theorem is the
statement that nothing is lost either way; here, as everywhere in this library,
the logic is taken as the definition of the class and the capture theorem is a
statement about machines, to be proved against a machine model rather than
assumed (see `DescriptiveComplexity.Machines`).

## What is *not* free here

* **PSPACE = coPSPACE** is not the definitional duality that gives `PiP k` from
  `SigmaP k`: the complement of an SO(TC) definable problem is not *obviously*
  SO(TC) definable. It is a genuine theorem, and it is proved – downstream, in
  `DescriptiveComplexity.PSpaceCompl`, once QSAT is available: every SO(TC)
  definable problem reduces to QSAT, complementing a reduction is free, and the
  walk that decides QSAT is deterministic, so reading its answer the other way
  round decides the complement.
* **PH ⊆ PSPACE** is not a syntactic inclusion either: a `Σₖ` sentence is not a
  walk. It too is proved downstream, in `DescriptiveComplexity.PSpaceHierarchy`,
  by alternating that complement with the other closure property of SO(TC) – a
  walk can guess a block into its own state and never touch it again – along the
  quantifier prefix. What *is* immediate here is the bottom of the tower,
  `NP ⊆ PSPACE` (`DescriptiveComplexity.NP_subset_PSPACE`): an existential block
  is a walk that guesses its state in one step and then stops, so
  `Σ₁`-definability is SO(TC) definability with an empty transition relation.
  Everything below NP follows by composition.

/-! ### `NP ⊆ PSPACE`: an existential block is a one-step walk

A `Σ₁` definition `∃ R̄. φ(R̄)` is the SO(TC) specification whose states are the
assignments of the block, whose transition relation is *empty*, and whose
starting and accepting states are both the ones satisfying `φ`. Its walks are
the one-state walks, so it accepts exactly when some assignment satisfies `φ`.

The only work is that an SO(TC) specification's sentences live over the
*ordered* expansion of the vocabulary, so the kernel has to be moved along the
language map that inserts the order symbol. -/
