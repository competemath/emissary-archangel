# Job sequencing

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.JobSequencing`, Karp's SEQUENCING – is
there a one-processor schedule whose late jobs carry a total penalty at most
the bound? – with the times, deadlines, penalties and bound written in
*binary* (`DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.BinRel`), which is what makes the
problem NP-hard rather than polynomial-time.

It collects the membership half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.jobSequencing_sigmaSODefinable`): the certificate guesses the
schedule as a linear order, the late jobs, and two ripple-carry walks – the
completion times along the schedule, the penalty total of the late jobs along
the instance's own order – and the kernel *compares* as well as adds, a job
being late exactly when its deadline falls below its completion time.

It also collects the hardness half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.nae3Sat_ordered_fo_reduction_jobSequencing`). Karp's reduction
from Partition does not transfer: its deadline and its bound are both half the
total execution time, and half of a total is an iterated sum, which no
first-order interpretation can write. The replacement starts from NAE-3SAT and
gives every digit block an even total – `2` per variable, `2 (w − 1)` per
clause of width `w` – so that the deadline is the digit-wise half, one bit per
block, the bound is the deadline, and a good schedule is a balanced split.
