# EVEN: the parity of a bare set

The textbook inexpressibility example ([Ebbinghaus–Flum 1995][ebbinghaus1995finite],
ch. 2; [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive], §6.1): over the *empty*
vocabulary – a structure is nothing but a finite set – decide whether the
universe has an even number of elements.

Nothing could be easier to compute, and nothing is further from first-order
logic. No sentence defines it
(`DescriptiveComplexity.even_not_foDefinableFree`) – one line of
Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé given the strategy on bare sets
(`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_card_bound_of_foDefinableFree`): a sentence of
quantifier rank `n` cannot tell a set with `2n + 2` elements from one with
`2n + 3`, the duplicator's supply of fresh elements outlasting the spoiler's
rounds on both sides. And no sentence defines it *with a linear order in hand*
either (`DescriptiveComplexity.even_not_foDefinable`), which is the theorem
with content: the structure then determines the position of every point, and
the duplicator still wins, for `2 ^ n` rounds' worth of elements
(`DescriptiveComplexity.efEquiv_linearOrder`).

Deciding it, on the other hand, is one walk along that same order – step to
the immediate successor, flip a bit – so EVEN *is* FO(≤, TC) definable
(`DescriptiveComplexity.even_tcDefinable`), hence in
`DescriptiveComplexity.NL`. The two halves together give `FO ⊊ FO(TC)`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_tcDefinable_not_foDefinable`): a *strict*
inclusion between two logics of this library, proved outright.

Deciding it needs no walk either, once formulas may do arithmetic: the greatest
element has rank `Nat.card A - 1`, so EVEN *is* AC⁰ definable
(`DescriptiveComplexity.even_ac0Definable`) by a sentence with one addition,
whence `FO(≤) ⊊ AC⁰` as well
(`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_ac0Definable_not_foDefinable`). That is the
parity of the *universe*; the parity of a marked *subset* is PARITY, the problem
outside AC⁰, about which nothing here is claimed.

Below the addition it is **one bit**: `Nat.card A` is even exactly when the
greatest element's rank is odd, that is, when its lowest bit is set. So EVEN is
also a sentence of the bit-level logic of `DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime` – two
existential registers over one bit atom
(`DescriptiveComplexity.even_bitDefinable`) – hence decided by an alternating
machine with a logarithmic clock (`DescriptiveComplexity.even_ltDecidable`) and,
through the multi-head automaton that evaluates that logic, in LOGSPACE a second
time (`DescriptiveComplexity.even_mem_LOGSPACE_bit`). The end of this file is
where that stack is exercised end to end, and it is the template for writing any
other sentence of that logic: semantically, with the
`DescriptiveComplexity.BitDef` combinators, never as syntax.

This is the first *unconditional* separation of the library – no complexity
assumption enters, in contrast with everything the completeness results say,
which is why the game layer is worth its cost.

The order-free result above says little on its own: a bare set carries no

size only up to `n`. The order-invariant statement is the real theorem – the
structure now *does* determine every point's position, and the sentence may
speak about it – and it needs Ehrenfeucht's theorem
(`DescriptiveComplexity.efEquiv_linearOrder`), whose bound is exponential
rather than linear in the quantifier rank. -/

No walk is needed either. A bare set carries no information beyond its size,

`Nat.card A - 1`, so the universe is even precisely when nothing doubles to it

only). With `DescriptiveComplexity.even_not_foDefinable` this gives
`FO(≤) ⊊ AC⁰` outright.

**This says nothing about PARITY.** EVEN asks the parity of the *universe* –
of the input's length, which a circuit family is indexed by and a sentence with
`+` reads off the top rank. PARITY asks the parity of a *marked subset*, part of
the input, and that is the problem outside AC⁰ by the switching lemma. The two
must not be confused: nothing here bears on the second, and this library proves
no AC⁰ lower bound. -/

/-- **EVEN is bit-definable**: two existential registers over a single bit atom.
The sentence is built with the `DescriptiveComplexity.BitDef` combinators –
`bitDef_isMax`, `bitDef_isZero`, `bitDef_bit`, `.and`, `.ex` – and read off only
at the end, exactly as `DescriptiveComplexity.ArithDef` is used one logic up. The
variable layout is the only bookkeeping: an `.ex` binds the variables of `Fin 1`
in `α ⊕ Fin 1`, so the register bound *first* is the outer one and is reached
through `Sum.inl`. -/
