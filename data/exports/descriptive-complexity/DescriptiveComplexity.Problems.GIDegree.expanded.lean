# The GI degree, collected

The degree is defined on `DescriptiveComplexity.GraphIso`, the undirected
problem the literature names GI. Its members therefore reach it through the
digraph-to-graph gadget of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.GraphIso.Hardness`, which is why the
completeness theorems of the problems stated over the *directed* vocabulary are
collected here rather than beside their reductions.

Complete for the degree: Graph Isomorphism itself
(`DescriptiveComplexity.graphIso_GI_complete`), Digraph Isomorphism
(`DescriptiveComplexity.digraphIso_GI_complete`) and DAG Isomorphism
(`DescriptiveComplexity.dagIso_GI_complete`).
