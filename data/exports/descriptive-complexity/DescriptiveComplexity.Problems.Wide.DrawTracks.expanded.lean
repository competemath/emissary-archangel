# Payloads by name, and the tape they present

`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Table` gives a state, a symbol and a transition each a
payload `Fin c → A`, and `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.pad` makes that payload the
element's only spelling. Nothing so far says what the coordinates *are*, and a
program that had to count them would be unreadable. This file names them:

> the payload is a function of a finite **slot** type, and a slot that carries a
> bit holds one of the two designated elements.

`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.slotPl` is the naming – a payload is `f ∘ e.symm` for
the canonical enumeration `e` of the slots, so two payloads are equal exactly
when the functions are – and `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.bitVal` is the bit, read
back by `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.bitVal_iff` from the two designated elements
being distinct. Between them, the distinctness obligations a transition table
owes (`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Table.Sep`) become statements about *named*
fields.

Which slots there are is not decided here.
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.DrawRules` splits them into the **control**
slots a state uses and the **track** slots a symbol uses, and builds the tape a
register pass runs over on top of the two.
