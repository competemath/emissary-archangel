# Value invention, bounded

`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewDefinable` guesses a finite extension
`A ⊕ Fin m` of the instance with `m` **unbounded**, and that single freedom is
what takes existential second-order logic from NP up to RE: the yes-instances
become those found by an unbounded search over finite witnesses.

This file puts the bound back, as a parameter. `∃SO[new, d]` guesses an
extension with at most `Nat.card (Fin d → A)` invented values – as many as there
are `d`-tuples of the instance – and the point of the notion is that the bound
does exactly what it should: it hands the search space back to the instance, so
the class is NP again. Read beside `PSPACE = NL.exp`, the family reads *invent
nothing* (`Σ₁`), *invent polynomially many* (here), *invent exponentially many*
(NEXPTIME) and *invent unboundedly many* (RE): one definition with one parameter.

## What is here

* `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewBddDefinable`: the polynomial bound;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewExpDefinable`: the exponential one, whose
  invented values are as many as the instance has tuples of `c` relations of
  arity `d`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable.toNewBdd`: `Σ₁ ⊆ ∃SO[new, d]`, by
  inventing nothing, which is the easy half of `∃SO[new, d] = NP`.

The converse half – that a bounded extension is definable inside the instance's
own `d`-tuples, so the guess can be moved back onto `A` – is the substance, and
lives in `DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderNewBddPull`, where the
`d`-dimensional interpreted universe enters; together the two give
`DescriptiveComplexity.sigmaSONewBddDefinable_iff_sigmaSODefinable`.

Note that neither the bound nor its absence is a *weakening* of the other: a
definability statement is an equivalence, so relaxing the bound loses the
backward direction and tightening it loses the forward one. Passing between the
notions means re-guarding the sentence, not reusing it.

/-- **Definability in `∃SO[new, exp c d]`**: the same logic with the number of
invented values held to `2 ^ (c · nᵈ)` – as many as the instance has tuples of
`c` relations of arity `d`, which is the size of an exponential expansion of it.
This is the middle rung of the family: *invent nothing* is `Σ₁`, *invent
polynomially many* is `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewBddDefinable`, *invent
unboundedly many* is `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewDefinable`.

Two constants and not one: at a one-element instance `nᵈ` is `1` whatever `d`
is, so a bound of `2 ^ nᵈ` would be the constant `2` there, while an expansion's
points at such an instance are `|Tag| · 2 ^ |B.ι|` – a constant the expansion
chooses. The factor `c` is what lets an arbitrary expansion fit. -/
