# AC⁰ definability: first-order logic with the numeric predicates

**The class AC⁰**, as a logic: a problem is `AC⁰` definable when a single
sentence over the *arithmetic* expansion of its vocabulary decides it on
nonempty finite ordered structures – first-order logic with `≤`, `+` and `×` on
the ranks of the elements (`DescriptiveComplexity.AC0Definable`). Classically
this is `FO(≤, +, ×) = FO(≤, BIT)`, and (DLOGTIME-)uniform AC⁰ ([Immerman
1999][immerman1999descriptive], Thm 1.17; [Barrington, Immerman & Straubing
1990][barrington1990uniformity]; in textbook form, [Vollmer
1999][vollmer1999introduction] Thm 4.73, with Thm 4.69 for the non-uniform
class); here, as everywhere in this library, the logic is the *definition*, and
the identification with a circuit model is a bridge that is not built – see
below.

## Why `+` and `×` rather than `BIT`

Expressively it makes no difference (the two are classically interdefinable –
a fact the literature states rather than proves: [Vollmer
1999][vollmer1999introduction] p. 163 attributes it to a 1994 e-mail of Lindell
and to [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive] §1.2.1, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime` proves it), so the choice is made by a proof
obligation elsewhere: the closure of the class
under first-order reductions must define the numeric predicates of the
*interpreted* universe – lexicographically ordered tagged tuples, hence base-`n`
digits – from those of the base. For `+` and `×` that is schoolbook arithmetic
on a constant number of digits; for `BIT` it is base-`n`-to-base-2 conversion,
whose only route is to define `+` and `×` on the tuples first. So `BIT` is a
later addition, not the primitive.

## Order-invariance, and the absence of an order-free variant

The definition quantifies over structures carrying a `LinearOrder`, and requires
the equivalence for *every* linear order: the sentence sees `≤, +, ×`, the
problem does not. This is verbatim the convention of
`DescriptiveComplexity.FODefinable`, and it is not a convenience here but a
necessity: the numeric predicates are *functions of the order*
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Arithmetic`), so there is no order-free reading of this
logic to state, and no `AC0DefinableFree` in this file. Together with
`DescriptiveComplexity.LOGSPACE`, whose logic is an operator rather than a
fragment, this is the second place where the bottom of the ladder breaks the
pattern of the classes above it.

## What is proved here, and what is not

* `FO(≤) ⊆ AC⁰` (`DescriptiveComplexity.FODefinable.ac0Definable`), by transport
  along `DescriptiveComplexity.sumOrderToArith`; the inclusion is **strict**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_ac0Definable_not_foDefinable`, in
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Even`), so the numeric predicates genuinely add
  power, unconditionally and with no complexity assumption.
* Closure under complement (`DescriptiveComplexity.AC0Definable.compl`) – free,
  since the defining object is a sentence, where every class above needed an
  argument (Immerman–Szelepcsényi for NL, a determinized walk for LOGSPACE).
* **Not** here: that AC⁰ definability is closed under first-order reductions
  (the arithmetic of an interpreted universe, as above), and therefore no
  `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass` yet; and no circuit model, so no
  capture theorem. The inclusion in `DescriptiveComplexity.LOGSPACE` is proved
  separately, through the multi-head automaton, and gives every consumer that
  the missing closure lemma would.
