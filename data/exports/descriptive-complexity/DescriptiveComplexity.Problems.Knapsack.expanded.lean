# Knapsack

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.Knapsack`, Karp's KNAPSACK – some set of
items whose weights sum exactly to the target – with the weights written in
*binary* (`DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.BinRel`), which is what makes the
problem NP-hard rather than polynomial-time.

It collects the membership half (`DescriptiveComplexity.knapsack_sigmaSODefinable`,
the certificate carrying the running totals and the carries of a ripple-carry
addition) and the hardness half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.exactCover_ordered_fo_reduction_knapsack`, one digit block of
bit positions per ground element of an exact-cover instance). Partition, Job
Sequencing and 0-1 Integer Programming follow from Knapsack.
