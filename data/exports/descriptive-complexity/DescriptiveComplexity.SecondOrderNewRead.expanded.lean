# Reading an expansion's defining sentences through the meanings

A defining sentence of an exponential expansion – the sentence that says whether
a relation of the expanded vocabulary holds of `k` points – is written over the
ordered base vocabulary expanded by `k` copies of the expansion's block
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.relSentence`). Value invention holds those
`k` points as `k` invented values of one extended universe, each standing for an
assignment of the block through a guessed **meaning relation**. So the sentence
has to be read with:

* its base symbols passing through untouched, but among the *original* elements
  only;
* its order symbol at a **guessed** linear order, the extended universe having
  none of its own;
* the block symbol of copy `i` and variable `j` read as `Mⱼ vᵢ ·`, the meaning
  relation of `j` at the value the copy holds.

That is a `DescriptiveComplexity.ParamHom` – the third item changes a symbol's
arity and puts a free variable in front of its arguments – followed by
relativization to the original elements, which
`DescriptiveComplexity.ParamHom.relOnSentenceF` performs in one step.

What this file adds is the map itself (`DescriptiveComplexity.readHom`) and what
it is worth (`DescriptiveComplexity.realize_readHom`): the structure the map
induces on the original elements *is* the base structure expanded by the `k`
copies of the block, interpreted by the assignments the values mean. The three
hypotheses that buy it name the three items above, each as a plain statement
about the target structure rather than about a formula.

The target vocabulary is left abstract, a
`DescriptiveComplexity.ReadSyms` naming only the symbols the translation uses:
the assembly that puts the order, the meanings, the tag bits and a guessed
certificate into one block chooses where each of them sits, and nothing here
needs to know.
