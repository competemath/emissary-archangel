# The exponential of a complexity class

`DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass.exp` reads a class over the *expanded*
universe: `P ∈ C.exp` when there is an exponential expansion `X` and a problem
`Q ∈ C` such that `P` holds of `A` exactly when `Q` holds of `X.Map A`. Since
the expanded universe of a size-`n` structure has `2^(n^a)` points, a resource
bound read there is one exponential higher than the same bound read on `A`.
This is the succinctness upgrade – trivial properties of circuit-described
graphs become NP-complete ([Galperin–Wigderson 1983][galperin1983succinct]),
NP-complete properties become NEXPTIME-complete ([Papadimitriou–Yannakakis
1986][papadimitriou1986note]), and the general statement is [Veith
1998][veith1998succinct] – stated as an *operator* rather than as a theorem
about one problem at a time.

The operator is applied to an **abstract** `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass`,
and that is the whole point of the design: the complement equalities, the
inclusions and the completeness transfers of the exponential classes are then
inherited from their polynomial-level counterparts instead of being reproved.

That `ExpDefinable C` is closed under (ordered) first-order reductions – so
that `C.exp` is a class at all – is
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.pullOrdered`: an interpretation followed by
an expansion is an expansion. Nothing about `C` is used, which is why the
closure holds at an arbitrary class.
