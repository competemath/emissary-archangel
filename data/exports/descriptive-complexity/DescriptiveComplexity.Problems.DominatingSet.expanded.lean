# Dominating Set is NP-complete

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.DominatingSet`, deriving NP-completeness from

* `DescriptiveComplexity.dominatingSet_sigmaSODefinable`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.DominatingSet.Membership`): membership, by guessing
  the dominating set and an injection of it into the marked set;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.DomRed.setCover_fo_reduction_dominatingSet`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.DominatingSet.Reduction`): hardness, from the
  NP-hardness of Set Cover, and so ultimately from the Cook–Levin theorem.

The reduction is **order-free**, which is worth recording: domination
constrains every element of the universe, junk tuples included, and the two
degenerate cases (an element in no set, and no element at all) look at first
sight as if they needed a canonical extra vertex – i.e., an order. They do not:
both are first-order conditions, so gating on them is enough.
