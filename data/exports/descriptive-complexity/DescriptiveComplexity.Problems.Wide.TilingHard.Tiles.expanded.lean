# The tiles a computation table is drawn with

The drawing behind `DescriptiveComplexity.WideTiling`'s hardness, written as
plain predicates before any formula: the tile system whose square is the
*computation table* of a clocked wide machine – a column is a tape address, a
row is a time step.

## What a tile carries

A tile is a tagged triple of elements of the machine's instance
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TileTag`):

* `dig` – not a tile at all, but a **digit**: the diagonal triples are the
  elements the grid's coordinates are subsets of, so the square is `2ⁿ × 2ⁿ`
  with `n` the size of the machine's instance;
* `sym a` – a cell holding the symbol `a`, with no head;
* `head a q τ` – the head is here, in the state `q`, reading `a` and firing the
  transition `τ`;
* `halt a q` – the head is here, in the state `q`, and fires nothing;
* `arrL a q` / `arrR a q` – no head yet, and one is about to arrive from the
  left (right) in the state `q`.

The head component carries the *transition*, not merely the state, because the
two local rules would otherwise each be free to choose their own: the vertical
one fixes the symbol written, the horizontal one the direction taken, and a tile
system whose two rules disagree describes no run at all.

## Why an arrival is a tile of its own

A vertical rule sees one column, so it cannot know that the neighboring head is
about to step into it; a horizontal rule sees one row, so it cannot know what the
next row holds. The arrival tile is the handshake between them: the horizontal
rule *justifies* it against the neighboring head, and the vertical rule *turns
it into* the head of the next row. That is what keeps a row to exactly one head
with rules that never see more than two cells.
