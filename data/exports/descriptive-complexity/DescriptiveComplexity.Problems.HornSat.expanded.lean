# HORN-SAT

Umbrella file for HORN-SAT, propositional satisfiability restricted to
formulas with at most one positive literal per clause: the canonical complete
problem for polynomial time.

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Defs`: the problem
  `DescriptiveComplexity.HORNSAT`, over the SAT vocabulary with the Horn condition
  `DescriptiveComplexity.AtMostOnePositive` folded into the yes-instances;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Membership`: `HORNSAT ∈ NP`, the SAT kernel
  conjoined with the first-order Horn condition;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Hardness`: the *Horn discharge* – every
  SO-Horn definable problem (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable`) admits an
  ordered first-order reduction to HORN-SAT;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Unsat`: `HORNSAT ∈ coNP`, by a first-order
  checkable certificate of Horn *un*satisfiability (a derivation-closed set
  with its derivation order). HORN-SAT is thus in `NP ∩ coNP`, as a
  polynomial-time problem should be, and complementing the discharge gives the
  level-0 inclusions of the hierarchy;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Definability`: `HORNSAT ∈ PTIME`, the Horn
  program computing unit propagation – which with the discharge makes HORN-SAT
  **PTIME-complete**.

What the two halves add up to is stated at the end of this file:
`DescriptiveComplexity.hornSat_PTIME_hard` and `DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME_subset_NP`.

## What the hardness statement says, and what it does not

The discharge `DescriptiveComplexity.hornSat_hard_of_sigmaSOHornDefinable` is the exact
analogue, one level down, of the Cook–Levin discharge
`DescriptiveComplexity.sat_hard_of_sigmaSODefinable`: it is the reason SAT is NP-hard
transposed to the Horn fragment, and it is meaningful *before* polynomial time
is defined – it says that HORN-SAT is at least as hard as everything the Horn
fragment can express. It is also markedly simpler, since a Horn program needs
no Tseitin gates.

One thing is deliberately *not* claimed: **Grädel's capture theorem against
machines is not formalized.** That SO-Horn captures polynomial time on ordered
structures ([Grädel 1992][gradel1992capturing]) has a direction – every
machine-polynomial-time problem is SO-Horn definable – that simulates a
machine, and so lies outside a machine-model-free library. So
`DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME` is *defined* as SO-Horn definability, exactly as NP is
defined as `Σ₁`-definability, and the identification with the
machine-theoretic class stays a citation.

Closure of level 0 under complement, by contrast, *is* a theorem. Since
HORN-SAT is PTIME-complete, `PiP 0 = SigmaP 0` is equivalent to a single crisp
question: **is Horn *un*satisfiability SO-Horn definable?** The certificate of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Unsat` only puts it in NP, and the fragment
cannot do it head-on: a Horn program accepts when the least model of its rules
satisfies its goal clauses, so to accept the *unsatisfiable* instances one
would have to derive a contradiction from a universally quantified statement
about the least model – the negative information a goal clause cannot supply.
The route that works is the logic-to-logic equivalence SO-Horn = FO(LFP) of
`DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointHorn`, a full logic being closed under negation by
construction; `DescriptiveComplexity.hornSat_compl_mem_PTIME` below is the resulting
answer, and `DescriptiveComplexity.piP_zero_eq` the resulting identity.
