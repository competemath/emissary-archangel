# SO(TC): second-order logic with transitive closure

The logic that captures polynomial space on ordered structures ([Immerman
1999][immerman1999descriptive], ch. 10): a transitive closure taken not over
tuples of *elements*, as in `DescriptiveComplexity.TransitiveClosure`, but over
tuples of *relations*. A state of the walk is an assignment of relations to a
second-order quantifier block, so a structure of size `n` has `2^(n^a)` states
and a walk through them is a computation of exponentially many steps – each one
first-order, hence cheap – on a polynomial amount of remembered information.
That is exactly the resource PSPACE measures.

## Why no fragment of plain SO would do

`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable` and its levels give the polynomial
hierarchy, and plain second-order logic gives `PH` as a whole
([Fagin 1974][fagin1974generalized]; [Stockmeyer
1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]), so no fragment of plain SO can define PSPACE
without collapsing PH. Some iteration operator is unavoidable, and the
transitive closure is the cheapest one: it needs no positivity condition, no
stage or inflationary machinery, and no syntax of its own.

## The operator as data

As in `DescriptiveComplexity.TransitiveClosure` (and for the same reasons – not
touching Mathlib's `FirstOrder.Language.BoundedFormula`), the operator lives at
the Lean level. A `DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec` bundles

* a second-order quantifier block `B`, whose assignments are the *states* of
  the walk;
* a `step` **sentence** over the base vocabulary expanded by the order and by
  *two* copies of the block – the current state and the next one;
* `src` and `tgt` sentences over one copy of the block.

Reachability itself is `Relation.ReflTransGen`, and a structure is accepted
when some `tgt` state is reachable from some `src` state
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec.Accepts`). A single application of `TC` in front
of a first-order matrix is taken as the definition, exactly as a single
existential block is taken as the definition of `Σ₁`-definability.

## No modes, no tuples

`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec` carries a finite *mode* beside its tuple of elements,
because a tuple of elements cannot hold finite data on a one-element universe.
Here nothing of the sort is needed: a relation variable of arity `0` *is* a
bit, so finite control is already inside a block, and a relation variable of
arity `1` holding a singleton is an element register. A state is therefore a
bare `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.Assignment` and the walk carries no extra
components – which also makes the pullback of a specification through an
interpretation (`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderTransitiveClosurePull`) purely a
matter of pulling the block back.

## What this file contains

The semantics (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec.Step`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec.Reach`, `DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec.Accepts`),
its isomorphism-invariance, the transfer of acceptance along a bijection of
states (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec.accepts_congr`, the workhorse of the
pullback), and the definability notion
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCDefinable`. The class `DescriptiveComplexity.PSPACE`
itself is built on top of it in `DescriptiveComplexity.PSpace`, once closure
under reductions is available.
