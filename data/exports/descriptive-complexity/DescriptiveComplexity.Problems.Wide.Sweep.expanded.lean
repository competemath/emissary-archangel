# The sweep of a wide machine

The primitive every program of a hardness reduction into a wide machine will
cite, and the last piece of the address layer:

> **A machine that takes a step at every increment of its address runs from the
> empty address to any address, and does so within its clock.**

`DescriptiveComplexity.stepsIn_of_wideSweep` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.accepts_of_wideSweep`. So a phase is described by giving
its intended configuration *at each address* and discharging a single-step
obligation between an address and its increment – a statement about the
transition table, with no induction and no counting.

Nothing here is new machinery: `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.stepsIn_of_segment`
already does the induction along the order, at an arbitrary position type, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.bitRank_lt_card` already does the clock. What this file
supplies is the identification of the three ends of that statement with the
address layer – the empty address is the least position
(`DescriptiveComplexity.minPos_wpLe_iff`), the full one is the last
(`DescriptiveComplexity.maxPos_wpLe_iff`), and a step is the binary increment
(`DescriptiveComplexity.succPos_wpLe_iff`) – so that a program never mentions
`SuccPos` again.

The initial configuration is settled here too. A reduction has no use for the
instance's input channel, its control being instance data already, so it leaves
`wmInp` empty; then the initial tape is **blank everywhere**
(`DescriptiveComplexity.initTape_of_no_wmInp`) and
`DescriptiveComplexity.isInit_wide` exhibits the one initial configuration: a
start state, the head on the empty address, every cell blank.
