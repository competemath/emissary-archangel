# 3SAT is NP-complete

Umbrella file for the problem 3SAT (`DescriptiveComplexity.ThreeSAT`, defined in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.ThreeSat.Defs`), collecting its two first-order
reductions –

* `DescriptiveComplexity.threeSat_fo_reduction_sat : ThreeSAT ≤ᶠᵒ SAT` (order-free,
  identity-like, gated on the first-order width check;
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.ThreeSat.ToSat`), and
* `DescriptiveComplexity.sat_ordered_fo_reduction_threeSat : SAT ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] ThreeSAT`
  (ordered, clause splitting along the occurrence order;
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.ThreeSat.FromSat`) –

and deriving its NP-completeness from the Cook–Levin theorem
([Cook 1971][cook1971complexity]; [Levin 1973][levin1973universal];
`DescriptiveComplexity.SAT_NP_complete`), with no machine model anywhere. As with any
complexity-theoretic statement, these results are about finite CNF structures
only (`ComplexityClass.mem_congr_finite`/`hard_congr_finite`).
