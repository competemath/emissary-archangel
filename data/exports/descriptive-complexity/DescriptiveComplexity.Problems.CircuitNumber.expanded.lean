# The number written by a circuit is complete for FP

`DescriptiveComplexity.CircuitNumber`: given a Boolean circuit with several
output gates and a comparison of them, compute the number whose binary digits
are the values of the outputs. It is the function counterpart of the circuit
value problem (`DescriptiveComplexity.CVP`), and plays for FP, under
parsimonious reductions, the part `CVP` plays for PTIME:
`DescriptiveComplexity.circuitNumber_FP_parsimoniousComplete`.

## The proof

* **Membership**: `DescriptiveComplexity.circuitNumber_mem_FP`. The fixed
  point is the evaluation of the gates, and the output is one quantitative
  term, `Σg. [g holds the digit 1] · Πh. ([h is an output below g] + 1)`.
* **Hardness for the functions given by their digits**:
  `DescriptiveComplexity.DigitDefinable.nonempty_orderedParsimonious`. A
  function whose binary digits are relations of a least fixed point
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.DigitDefinable`) reduces to the problem by an ordered
  parsimonious reduction: the rules are drawn as a monotone circuit, one
  disjunction gate per atom and one conjunction chain per rule instance
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.CircNum.drawInterp`).
* **The normal form**: `DescriptiveComplexity.FPDefinable.digitDefinable`.
  Every problem of FP – a quantitative term, with sums and products over the
  universe, read at a least fixed point – has its binary digits defined by a
  least fixed point. This is where the work is: the digits of iterated sums and
  products are computed by a tower of inflationary inductions
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Counting.Digits`).

So the digit-definable problems are exactly those of FP
(`DescriptiveComplexity.digitDefinable_iff_mem_FP`): the normal form in the
proof that QFO(LFP) captures FP
([Arenas, Muñoz, Riveros 2020][arenas2020descriptive], Theorem 4.4), here a
theorem about the logic with no machine in it.

## Relativized reductions

FP is closed under *relativized* parsimonious reductions as well
(`DescriptiveComplexity.mem_FP_of_relOrderedParsimonious`), those whose target
universe is a definable set of tagged tuples. No pullback of a quantitative
term through such a reduction is needed: the reduction is composed down to
this problem, which ignores isolated elements
(`DescriptiveComplexity.circuitNumber_of_embedding`), so that the tuples
outside the domain can be kept.

## Attribution

The statement that this problem is complete for FP under first-order
parsimonious reductions was not found in the literature. Under polynomial-time
reductions every function of FP is complete for it, so the question only
arises for reductions this weak; the proof combines the normal form of
Arenas, Muñoz and Riveros with the classical completeness of circuit value
for PTIME.
