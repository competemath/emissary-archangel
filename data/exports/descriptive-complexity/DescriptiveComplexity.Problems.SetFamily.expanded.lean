# The set family is NP-complete

Umbrella file for the three problems on set systems – Set Cover, Hitting Set
and Set Packing (`DescriptiveComplexity.SetCover`, `DescriptiveComplexity.HittingSet`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.SetPacking`, defined in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.SetFamily.Defs`) – collecting the quantifier-free
reductions of `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.SetFamily.Reductions` (the transposition
relating Set Cover and Hitting Set) and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.SetFamily.FromGraphs` (the edge-incidence reading of a
marked graph), and deriving NP-completeness from

* `DescriptiveComplexity.setCover_sigmaSODefinable` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.setPacking_sigmaSODefinable`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.SetFamily.Membership`): membership, by guessing the
  subfamily and the injection witnessing the threshold;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.vertexCover_fo_reduction_setCover` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.indSet_fo_reduction_setPacking`: hardness, from the
  NP-hardness of Vertex Cover and Independent Set
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.CliqueFamily`), and so ultimately from the
  Cook–Levin theorem, with no machine model anywhere.

Membership then travels backward and hardness forward along the transposition,
which relates Set Cover and Hitting Set in both directions, giving
`DescriptiveComplexity.hittingSet_NP_complete`. This is the set-system mirror of the
clique family: there, complementation relates the three graph problems and one
`Σ₁` definition serves them all; here the transposition relates two of them,
while Set Packing – whose threshold is a lower bound, like Clique's – carries
its own definition. As with any complexity-theoretic statement, these results
are about finite set systems only
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass.mem_congr_finite`/`hard_congr_finite`).
