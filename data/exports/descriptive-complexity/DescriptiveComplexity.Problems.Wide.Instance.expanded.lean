# A wide machine that accepts

The three wide problems fold their promises into their yes-instances, and a
membership theorem about a *vacuous* problem would say nothing. This file closes
that gap by exhibiting one instance, the smallest there is, and proving all three
problems hold of it:

> two elements – one that is both a start state and an accepting state, one that
> is the blank – no transitions at all, and the order they come in.

Its machine starts on the empty address in an accepting state, so it accepts in
**no steps**; having no transitions it is deterministic, so the deterministic
space-bounded problem holds of it too. Nothing about addresses is used beyond
`DescriptiveComplexity.isInit_wide` – the head starts on the empty address and the
tape is blank – which is the point: the promises reduce to conditions on the
instance (`DescriptiveComplexity.wideData_wellFormed_iff`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.wideData_deterministic_iff`) and those conditions are
satisfiable.

The instance is also the smallest exercise of the interface a hardness reduction
will use, so it is worth reading as a template: a `FirstOrder.Language.wide`
structure is eleven relations on a finite type, and the two promises are then
four conditions and four more.
