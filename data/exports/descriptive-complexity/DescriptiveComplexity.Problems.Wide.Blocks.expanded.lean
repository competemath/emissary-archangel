# An address, read block by block

A reduction into a wide machine chooses the order `wmLe` of the instance it
draws, and the whole design of the sweep depends on choosing it **block-major**:
the universe of the instance is a product `T × V` – a block index and a
coordinate – ordered by `DescriptiveComplexity.lexRel`, so that an address is a
*family of blocks*, one per index (`DescriptiveComplexity.wmBlk`). One block per
variable of the kernel, one for the scratch, and the sweep's two structural facts
become theorems about this decomposition:

* **the address order is lexicographic on blocks**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLt_lexRel_iff`): two addresses compare at the least
  index where their blocks differ. So the addresses agreeing on a prefix of the
  blocks form a *contiguous stretch* of the tape, which is what lets a guessed
  relation of arity smaller than the number of variables be kept consistent by
  one state bit rather than by comparing distant cells;
* **the increment carries block by block**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.wmIncr_lexRel_iff`): there is a last index whose block
  is not full, that block increments, every later block is emptied and every
  earlier one is untouched. That is the roll-over information the sweep folds its
  accumulators by – “which variables have just been requantified” – and it is what
  a machine computes when it increments the mirror of its own head position.

A third fact comes from the same reading and is what a program *on a clock*
lives on:

* **the addresses avoiding a set of blocks are an initial stretch**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.wmAvoids_of_wmSetLe`), provided the set is closed
  downwards in the index order – the smallest index being the most significant
  digit. So a program that keeps its data in the least significant blocks and
  leaves the others empty never leaves a segment of the tape at the bottom, and
  the surplus blocks multiply its clock while costing it nothing.

All of them are stated at arbitrary linear order relations on `T` and on `V`, so
they apply to whatever key a reduction chooses;
`DescriptiveComplexity.isLinOrd_lexRel` supplies the linearity of the product.

/-! ### The working region

A program that keeps its data in the *least significant* blocks and leaves the
others empty never leaves an initial stretch of the tape: the smallest block
index is the most significant digit, so putting anything in a block a program
avoids makes an address bigger than every address that avoids it. That is what
buys a clocked program its budget – the surplus blocks multiply the clock and
cost the program nothing – and what makes “the region” a segment rather than a
scattered set. -/
