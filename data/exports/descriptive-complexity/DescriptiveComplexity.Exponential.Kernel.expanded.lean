# What a NEXPTIME source problem looks like

`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpDefinable` `DescriptiveComplexity.NP` is the class the
hardness proof for `DescriptiveComplexity.WideAccept` starts from, and it is
stated as an existential over an expansion and a *problem* of `NP`. A machine
cannot be programmed against that. This file puts it in the normal form a program
is written against:

> **an expansion, one block of guessed relation variables, and a first-order
> kernel** – `DescriptiveComplexity.NexKernel` – the problem holding at a
> structure exactly when some assignment of the block satisfies the kernel over
> its expansion.

That is the same shape as the data of the EXPSPACE program – an expansion, a
block, a first-order body – with the block's relation variables **guessed** once
rather than iterated to a fixed point, which is the whole difference between the
two programs.

## The order

The kernel is stated over `L.sum FirstOrder.Language.order`, one language wider
than `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable` supplies. Nothing is added by that:
a machine has an order on its universe whatever the source says, the atoms of an
ordered kernel are what the program's atom machinery is written for, and a
sentence that mentions no order symbol is a sentence that may. The transport is
`DescriptiveComplexity.orderAddLHom`, the dual of
`DescriptiveComplexity.orderElimLHom` – which eliminates an order symbol by
re-quantifying it inside a block, and is the direction that costs something.

Which linear order is on the expanded universe is left to the consumer: the
normal form holds at **every** one, so a reduction may choose the order its
encoding induces and pay nothing for the choice.
