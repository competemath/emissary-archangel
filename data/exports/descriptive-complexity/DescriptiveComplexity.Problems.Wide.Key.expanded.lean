# The order key a reduction writes is the block-major one

The address layer of a wide machine reads an address over a universe `T × V`
ordered by `DescriptiveComplexity.lexRel` – block index first, coordinate second
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Blocks`). A reduction's universe is a
*tagged tuple* `Tag × (Fin d → A)`, and the only order on it that a first-order
interpretation can define is the one the library already has,
`DescriptiveComplexity.tagTupleLe`, whose defining formula is
`DescriptiveComplexity.lexLeF`.

They are the same order:

> `DescriptiveComplexity.Wide.tagTupleLe_iff_lexRel` – the definable order on a tagged
> tuple universe **is** `lexRel` of the tag order and the lexicographic order on
> coordinates.

So a reduction writes `DescriptiveComplexity.lexLeF` for `wmLe`, takes its tag
type to be `Fin n` – one index per variable of its kernel, plus the scratch – and
the whole of `Blocks`, `Bridge` and the fold applies to the instance it has drawn.
This is the last thing that has to be checked before a program is written: it is
what makes the layout *definable* rather than merely convenient.

The two linearity facts come with it, since every lemma of the address layer asks
for them: `DescriptiveComplexity.Wide.isLinOrd_tagTupleLe`, transported from the
`LinearOrder` the library builds by `DescriptiveComplexity.tagTupleOrder`, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Wide.isLinOrd_tupLeLex`, which is the same statement with no
tag at all.

/-! ### The index a clocked program lays its file out by

A program with no clock gives every element of the universe a register; a
clocked one cannot, since the only stretches it can walk are a fixed number of
tuple roll-overs long and the universe is `|Tag|` of those. What it can afford
is one register per **block and tuple**, which is also all that a register's
contents ever depend on. Its order is the lexicographic product of the block
order and the tuples' (`DescriptiveComplexity.lexRel`), and the block order is
written down rather than borrowed: it has to be the one under which a block's
tag is monotone, so that a mark on the file counts in the same order as the
address it stands for (`DescriptiveComplexity.ixAddr`). -/
