# 0-1 integer programming

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.ZeroOneIP`, Karp's 0-1 INTEGER
PROGRAMMING – is there a `0-1` vector `x` with `C x = d`? – with the entries
written in *binary* (`DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.BinRel`), which is what
makes the problem NP-hard rather than polynomial-time.

It collects the membership half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.zeroOneIP_sigmaSODefinable`, the certificate carrying one
ripple-carry walk per row) and the hardness half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.knapsack_ordered_fo_reduction_zeroOneIP`): a single equation
with `0-1` variables *is* a subset-sum instance, so Knapsack reduces to it by
a one-tag, dimension-one interpretation whose only piece of work is naming the
single row, the minimum of the input order.
