# Machine acceptance is NP-complete, and its deterministic restriction PTIME-complete

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.NTMAccept`, the problem “does this
nondeterministic Turing machine accept its input within as many steps as there
are positions?”, with the machine carried by the instance.

The point of the problem is the machine bridge: every class
in this library is a definition in logic and every completeness theorem is
discharged by a first-order reduction, so that these classes really are *the*
NP and *the* P was, until this file, a citation. `NTMAccept` closes that gap
from inside the framework:

* **membership** (`DescriptiveComplexity.ntmAccept_mem_NP`,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Membership`) is Fagin's tableau argument – one
  existential block guesses the run, a first-order kernel checks it, and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.accepts_iff_exists_walk` turns an `ℕ`-indexed run into
  one indexed by the position elements, which is where the unary time bound is
  cashed in;
* **hardness** (`DescriptiveComplexity.ntmAccept_NP_hard`) is the reduction
  `SAT ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] NTMAccept`: a bespoke machine – guess an assignment in one sweep,
  check one clause per sweep, alternating direction – built *semantically* in
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Hardness` on the tape of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Tape`, run by the phase machinery of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Program`, and transcribed into defining
  formulas in `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Interp`.

Two consequences are worth naming. `DescriptiveComplexity.mem_NP_iff_le_ntmAccept` is
the machine characterization of the class: a problem is in NP – that is,
`Σ₁`-definable – exactly when it ordered-FO-reduces to machine acceptance.
And `DescriptiveComplexity.ntmAccept_reduces_to_sat` is the *textbook form* of the
Cook–Levin theorem – machine acceptance reduces to satisfiability – obtained
from the machine-free Tseitin discharge with no tableau-to-CNF encoding: the
membership proof already wrote the run as a `Σ₁` formula, and the generic
reduction to SAT applies to it like to any other. Conjoined with the hardness
direction, this gives `DescriptiveComplexity.ntmAccept_interreducible_sat` –
machine acceptance and satisfiability reduce to each other – the most faithful
representation of the Cook–Levin theorem this library offers.
`DescriptiveComplexity.SAT_complete_for_ntmAccept` states the same content with
the hardness half quantified over the class, which is SAT's NP-completeness for
the NP the *machine* defines and the form to compare with the mechanizations
that prove Cook–Levin over a machine model.

As with any complexity-theoretic statement, these results are about finite
structures only
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass.mem_congr_finite`/`hard_congr_finite`).

This is `ntmAccept_interreducible_sat` with the hardness half quantified over
the class rather than stated at one problem, which is the form the mechanized
Cook–Levin literature proves; it is the statement to compare against, since
nothing here is definitional about the logically defined
`DescriptiveComplexity.NP` – the class it is complete for is the one the
machine defines. The extra content over the interreducible form is exactly the
cofinal quantifier: `DescriptiveComplexity.mem_NP_iff_le_ntmAccept` turns an
arbitrary problem accepted by a machine into a `Σ₁` definition, which the
generic discharge then sends to `DescriptiveComplexity.SAT`.

The same bridge one level down, for `DescriptiveComplexity.DTMAccept`: membership –
a deterministic run is a least fixed point, proved in

SO-Horn translation – and hardness by the unit-propagation machine of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.HornHardness`, transcribed in

machine acceptance PTIME-complete, and the library's logically defined
polynomial time the machine one. -/

/-! ### The space-bounded problems

Drop the step bound and the same machines measure *space* instead of time: a
run of `DescriptiveComplexity.NTMAcceptSpace` may be arbitrarily long, but it
never leaves the positions of the instance, so its configurations are the
assignments of a fixed second-order block and its runs are a transitive closure
over them. That is exactly an SO(TC) specification, so both problems are in
PSPACE (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Space`). Hardness is proved once,
for the *deterministic* problem, by the QBF-evaluating machine of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.QsatInterp`, and travels to the
nondeterministic one along `DescriptiveComplexity.dtmAcceptSpace_fo_reduction_ntmAcceptSpace`
– hardness moves forward along reductions, which is why the deterministic
problem is the one to prove hard and why Savitch is never run on the machine
side. Both are therefore PSPACE-complete. -/
