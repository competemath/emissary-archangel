# Small universes are transparent: how to drop a size condition

Every packing argument of Immerman's mutual definability needs the universe to
be above a concrete size – there is no room to lay a certificate out in a
universe of three elements – and a statement gated by `n ≥ N` is a statement
that has to carry `n ≥ N` for ever after. This file is what discharges such a
hypothesis, and it is stated once for both logics:

> A **numeric** relation – one that depends only on the size of the universe and
> on the ranks of its arguments – is definable on universes of at most `k`
> elements, whatever it is (`DescriptiveComplexity.arithDef_of_card_le`,
> `DescriptiveComplexity.bitDef_of_card_le`). So a numeric relation definable on
> the *large* universes is definable outright
> (`DescriptiveComplexity.ArithDef.of_large`,
> `DescriptiveComplexity.BitDef.of_large`).

The reason is that an order **names** its elements: `orank x = j` is first-order
for each numeral `j` (`DescriptiveComplexity.arithDef_orankEq`, by `j`
successors), and `Nat.card A = n` is first-order for each numeral `n`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.arithDef_cardEq`). Below a fixed size there are finitely
many (size, tuple of ranks) cases, so the relation *is* an explicit finite
disjunction, one disjunct per case, each disjunct a conjunction of namings and a
truth value decided outside the structure.

## What it is for

A construction that lays out a certificate says what it needs of `n` and proves
its statement for those `n` only; this turns that into the statement with no
side condition. It is the shared prerequisite of two developments – the Bit Sum
Lemma (`LogTime/BitSum/`, whose packing levels each need `n` above a bound) and
the tuple arithmetic of AC⁰ class-hood (whose half-width splitting needs
`n ≥ 3`) – and it is deliberately built before either.

The finiteness hypothesis is on the *variables*, not on anything else: a
disjunction over the rank assignments of infinitely many variables is not a
formula. Every consumer has finitely many, and states them as a `Fin m`.
