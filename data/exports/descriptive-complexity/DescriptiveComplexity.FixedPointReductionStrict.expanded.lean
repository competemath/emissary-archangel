# FO(LFP) reductions are strictly stronger than first-order ones

`DescriptiveComplexity.FOReduction.toLFP` embeds every first-order reduction
into the FO(LFP) ones. This file shows the embedding is **strict**, and
unconditionally: there is a problem to which EVEN reduces in FO(LFP) and to
which it reduces by no first-order reduction at all
(`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_lfpReduction_not_orderedReduction`).

The witness is as small as it can be. Let `NONEMPTYMARK` be “the marked subset
is nonempty”, over the vocabulary of a marked set
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Parity`). It is first-order definable – one
existential quantifier – so nothing that first-order reduces to it is harder
than a first-order sentence, and EVEN is not
(`DescriptiveComplexity.even_not_foDefinable`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.even_not_le_of_foDefinable`). Yet EVEN *does* FO(LFP)
reduce to it: mark every element if the universe is even, none if it is odd.
Deciding which is a polynomial-time question, so an induction settles it – the
one already at hand, since EVEN is in PTIME – and the reduction's marking
formula is that induction's output sentence, read with a free variable it
ignores.

Two things to read off this.

* The gap is not about *hardness*: EVEN is in LOGSPACE, `NONEMPTYMARK` is
  first-order, and neither is hard for anything. It is about what a reduction
  may *compute* on its way, which is exactly the difference between AC⁰ and
  polynomial time.
* A reduction notion that can decide its source problem outright trivializes
  every problem it can decide: `NONEMPTYMARK` is a target only because the
  interpretation may answer the question itself. That is why the classical
  theory measures classes *above* the reductions' own power, and why the
  library's own hardness results stay stated with `≤ᶠᵒ[≤]`, where no such
  collapse happens.
