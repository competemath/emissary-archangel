# One step of a wide machine, packaged

`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Step` asks for eight things at once – a transition,
its source, its read symbol, its destination, its written symbol, the frame
condition on the untouched cells, the direction, and the neighbor relation on the
head. A program of a hardness reduction discharges them at *every* phase, so they
are packaged here once:

> `DescriptiveComplexity.step_wide_right` – a right-moving step from an address to
> its increment, given a transition of the instance and the symbol the head is
> reading.

The new tape is given as an arbitrary function with the two conditions a step
imposes – its value at the head, and agreement elsewhere – rather than as
`Function.update`, since an address is a *set* and equality of addresses is not
decidable. `DescriptiveComplexity.step_wide_left` is the same reading backwards,
for a phase that sweeps down.

On top of it, `DescriptiveComplexity.accepts_of_rightSweep` is the shape a
one-pass program has: give a state and a tape *per address*, check one transition
per increment, start blank on the empty address, and end accepting. That is the
whole of `DescriptiveComplexity.WideAccept` for a monotone sweep, with no run, no
counting and no `DescriptiveComplexity.SuccPos` in sight.

/-- **A right-moving step of a wide machine**: the head is on the address `s`
reading the symbol `a`, the transition `τ` applies to the state `q` and that
symbol, and the machine writes `a'`, moves to the state `q'` and steps to the
increment of `s`.

The new tape is given as an arbitrary function with the two conditions a step
imposes on it – its value at the head, and agreement elsewhere – rather than as
`Function.update`: an address is a *set*, so equality of addresses is not
decidable, and a program's tapes are given by formulas anyway. -/
