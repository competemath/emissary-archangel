# The layout's geometry is the padding layer's, so its formulas are written

The bridge the defining formulas of the EXPSPACE reduction are read through.
`DescriptiveComplexity.Padding` already carries the shape formulas every
tagged-tuple interpretation in this library needs – a coordinate is the least
element (`DescriptiveComplexity.botF`), a tuple is canonically padded
(`DescriptiveComplexity.canonF`), two tuples are equal
(`DescriptiveComplexity.eqTupF`), they agree below a length
(`DescriptiveComplexity.agreeF`), one is the padded reading of the other
through an index map (`DescriptiveComplexity.padTupF`) – each with its
realization lemma. The EXPSPACE layout speaks of the same objects under its own
names (`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.pad`, `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.unpad`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.IsPad`), and this file says they are the same:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.pad_eq_pad` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.unpad_eq_pref` – the two paddings and the two
  readings are one definition;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.isPad_iff_canon` – being canonically padded *is*
  being canonical, once the designated `zero` is the order's least element,
  which is the choice a reduction into
  `DescriptiveComplexity.DWideAcceptSpace` makes anyway (an interpretation
  cannot name an arbitrary element, and the two designated ones have to be
  `⊥` and `⊤`);
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.realize_canonF_isPad` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.realize_padTupF_pad` – the two realizations in the
  layout's own vocabulary, which is the form the eleven defining formulas will
  cite.

So the *shape* half of the interpretation is already written. What is not, and
what the remaining work is, is the **rule** half: a transition's guard and what
it writes are arbitrary functions in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Rule`, and each kit owes a syntactic counterpart –
a quantifier-free formula over the payload slots for the guard, and per-slot
“copy this slot or write this constant” for the destination and the written
symbol.
