# The class RE, defined by value invention

**RE** (`DescriptiveComplexity.RE`), the recursively enumerable problems,
*defined* – like every class in this library – by a logic: definability in
`∃SO[new]`, existential second-order logic over a universe extended by finitely
many invented values (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewDefinable`, in
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderNew`).

It is a bona fide `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass` because `∃SO[new]`
definability is closed under (ordered) first-order reductions
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewDefinable.of_foReduction` in
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderNewPull`, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSONewDefinable.of_orderedReduction` in
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderNewOrdered`): the target's extended universe
is definable inside the source's, with the same invented values, so the kernel
pulls back through a relativized interpretation, and the order of an ordered
reduction is re-quantified inside the block under a guard relativized to the
original elements.

`DescriptiveComplexity.NP_subset_RE` is the inclusion `NP ⊆ RE`, by inventing
nothing.

## What this file claims, and where the rest is

RE is here a *logically defined* class, exactly as NP is `Σ₁`-definability
rather than a machine notion: a completeness proof for it is an `∃SO[new]`
definition plus a first-order reduction. Two facts about it are proved
elsewhere, where the class meets Mathlib's computability layer, and nothing in
this file assumes them:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.mem_RE_iff_rePred` – RE *is* recursive enumerability:
  a problem is `∃SO[new]`-definable exactly when its concrete instances form an
  `REPred`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.RE_ne_coRE` – RE differs from its complement
  `DescriptiveComplexity.coRE`. That separation is not available here:
  `coNP = Π₁ᵖ` has a *logical* dual definition, while `∃SO[new]` has no dual
  reading, so nothing in this file relates the two classes. It is the
  undecidability of an RE-complete problem, through Post's theorem, that
  separates them.

Both are in `DescriptiveComplexity.Computability.CodeHaltComplete`.
