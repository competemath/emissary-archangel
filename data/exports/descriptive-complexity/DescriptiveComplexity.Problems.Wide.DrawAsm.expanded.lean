# Assembling a program from call sites

The EXPSPACE program is large, but its rule set is a **sum over call sites**
of small, separately checkable contributions – kit instantiations plus their
exit rules. This file is the assembly: a
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Assembly` packages a family of per-site rule
shapes, an ownership map from phases to sites, and the two coherence facts
(every rule fires from a phase its site owns; each site separates in-shape);
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Assembly.prog` is the program whose rule names are
the sigma, and `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Assembly.sep` its separation –
via `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.sep_sigma`, so
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Table.deterministic` applies with no global case
bash.

The point of the shape: the concrete program need never be stated as one
monolithic rule inductive. Each call site is built and checked in its own
file – its `Sh i` a kit rule type (or a sum of one with its exit rules), its
`hsep i` the kit's `sep` plus its `exit_disjoint` – and the assembly is the
only place they meet.
