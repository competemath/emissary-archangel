# `TIMES` from `BSUM`: multiplication of ranks, in the bit logic

The last step of [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive] Thm 1.17(1), and the
one the textbook leaves entirely to the reader: with the Bit Sum Lemma in hand
(`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.PopAll`), define `orank x * orank y = orank z`
in `FO(≤, BIT)`. The design gap it closes is recorded in the module docstring
of `DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime.BitSum.Columns`; the certificate here has
three layers, each guessed and pinned locally, none ever computing a product:

* **A column** (`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.ColCount`): the word whose ones
  are the pairs of set bits of `x` and `y` meeting at one column – a sub-mask
  of `y`, read off bit by bit – counted by the Bit Sum Lemma.
* **A range of columns** (`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.RangeSum`): the
  weighted sum `Σ_t c_{a+t} 2 ^ t` of the columns `[a, e)`, certified by a
  **carry chain**: the remainders of the column-by-column addition, packed one
  field per column into a single element, walked with the boundary set and the
  counter of `LogTime/BitSum/Blocks` and `Counter`, each step one
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.StepEq` – an addition and a bit of the result.
* **The product** (`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.TimesCert`): cut the columns
  into blocks of `g` with `2 ^ g > P`, so a block sum has `2 g` bits and the
  fields of the even (resp. odd) blocks tile an element exactly; one guessed
  element per parity, their windows certified by `RangeSum`, a tail from the
  last boundary to the top of the tape, and **two additions** put the product
  together. A no-overflow clause makes the columns end below the top, which is
  what confines the whole sum to the tape.

Soundness holds for whatever is guessed
(`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.rangeSum_sound` takes no size hypothesis), the
sizes are paid once in the completeness half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.timesCert_of_eq`, above the threshold of
`LogTime/BitSum/Sizes`), and `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.bitDef_times`
discharges the threshold with `DescriptiveComplexity.BitDef.of_large`. The
result, `DescriptiveComplexity.timesBitDef`, is consumed in
`LogTime/Translate.lean`, where it closes `AC⁰ = FO(≤, BIT)` – the machine
model *is* AC⁰.
