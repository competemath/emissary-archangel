# A quantifier-free matrix is a Boolean function of its atoms

The machine evaluates the matrix of its step formula **atom by atom**: a
subroutine per atom, each ending in a state that records whether that atom holds,
the accumulating assignment kept in the *coordinates* of the state – one
coordinate per atom, holding one of the two designated elements the tracks of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.DrawTracks` carry. When every atom has been
evaluated, one transition reads off the answer.

For that to be correct the matrix must be a function of its atoms' truths, and
this file says so:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.qfValue` – the value of a formula given a truth value
  for each atom;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.realize_qfValue` – on a quantifier-free formula it is
  the realization;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.qfAtoms` – the atoms, finitely many;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.qfValue_congr` – only those matter, so a machine that
  has evaluated them has evaluated the matrix.

The last two are what make the phase count *linear* in the number of atoms rather
than exponential in it: the machine visits `qfAtoms` once and the final transition
is a disjunction over the assignments that satisfy `qfValue`, a finite list a
defining formula can write out.

**The recursion is total, the correctness is not.** `IsQF` is a `Prop`, so a
definition cannot recurse on it; `qfValue` and `qfAtoms` are therefore defined on
*every* bounded formula, sending a quantifier node to `False` and to `[]`, and
correctness is proved by induction on `FirstOrder.Language.BoundedFormula.IsQF`,
where no such node is reachable. This is the shape of
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.translQF` in `Exponential/Matrix.lean`, and it
is the standard way to recurse on a syntactic class carved out by a `Prop`.
Discarding the quantifier node is also why the list stays at one depth: a
quantifier-free formula never changes it.
