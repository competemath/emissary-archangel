# FO(LFP): first-order logic with a least fixed point

The logic FO(LFP) ([Immerman 1986][immerman1986relational]; [Vardi
1982][vardi1982complexity]), in the clausal normal form this library uses for
kernels everywhere else: a `DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDef` bundles

* a block of relation variables and a finite list of *rules* deriving them –
  the same `DescriptiveComplexity.HornClause` data as an SO-Horn program, read here as
  an inductive definition rather than a constraint;
* an arbitrary first-order *output* sentence over the input vocabulary
  expanded by those variables, evaluated at the least fixed point.

## Why the output formula is the point

The fixed point is the same object in both logics – the least model of a set
of rules. What distinguishes FO(LFP) from SO-Horn is what one is allowed to
say *about* it. An SO-Horn program can only reject models, through goal
clauses, and a goal clause tests its atoms positively; FO(LFP) evaluates an
unrestricted first-order sentence, so it may negate fixed-point atoms.

That is exactly the closure that SO-Horn lacks: `DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDefinable` is
closed under complement by negating the output
(`DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDefinable.compl`, a one-liner), whereas the corresponding
statement for SO-Horn is open – see `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat`. The
inclusion `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable.lfpDefinable` transports every
SO-Horn definition into this logic, so PTIME as defined by the Horn fragment
sits inside FO(LFP) together with its complements.

## What is proved here, and where the equivalence is completed

`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable.lfpDefinable` is one half of the equivalence
of the two formalisms: every SO-Horn definition is an FO(LFP) definition. The
other half – bringing an FO(LFP) definition back into the Horn fragment – is
the translation of `DescriptiveComplexity.FixedPointHorn`, built on the stage theory of
this file: the stages `DescriptiveComplexity.derivesIn` stabilize once the atom count is
reached (`DescriptiveComplexity.derivesIn_iff_derives_of_card_le`), so a stage indexed by
a large enough tuple stands in for the fixed point, and its *complement* can
be derived positively, one stage at a time. Together the two halves make the
notions interchangeable (`DescriptiveComplexity.lfpDefinable_iff_sigmaSOHornDefinable`)
and give `PiP 0 = SigmaP 0` (`DescriptiveComplexity.piP_zero_eq`).

The notion is also closed under (ordered) first-order reductions
(`DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDefinable.of_orderedReduction`), so it is class-worthy in the
sense of `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass`.

A second consumer of the stage theory is not formalized: a `Σ₁` definition,
giving `FO(LFP) ⊆ NP` directly, would *guess* a fixed point together with a
well-founded derivation order and check both first-order. The semantic key is
provided here – `DescriptiveComplexity.derives_eq_of_closed_of_wf` says that a relation
*closed* under the rules and *well-foundedly derivable* is exactly the least
fixed point, `DescriptiveComplexity.derives_step_of_depth` supplies the witnessing
order from the stages, and `DescriptiveComplexity.LFPDef.holds_iff_of_certificate`
packages this; the formulas themselves are not built. (The inclusion itself
follows by composing the translation with the Horn membership of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat`.)

## The fixed point

Rather than a stage-indexed iteration, the least model is the inductive
predicate `DescriptiveComplexity.Derives`: a tuple is derived when some rule fires on
already-derived tuples. Being an inductive definition it comes with exactly the
two properties a least fixed point needs – it satisfies the rules
(`DescriptiveComplexity.lfpAssign_rule`) and it is contained in every assignment that
does (`DescriptiveComplexity.lfpAssign_least`).

Rules whose head is `none` derive nothing and are simply inert here, so an
SO-Horn program can be handed over unchanged: its goal clauses reappear in the
output formula.

/-! ### Stages, depth, and the certificate characterization

Putting FO(LFP) back into the Horn fragment, and certifying a fixed point in
`Σ₁`, both need the same thing: a way to say
“this relation *is* the least fixed point” that a *positive* formalism can
test. Closure alone is not enough (anything larger is closed too); what pins
the least fixed point down is closure together with *well-founded
derivability* – every element derived by a rule from strictly earlier
elements. That is `DescriptiveComplexity.derives_eq_of_closed_of_wf` below, and the
stages provide the witnessing order. -/
