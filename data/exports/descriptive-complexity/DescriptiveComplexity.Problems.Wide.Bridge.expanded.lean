# The blocks of an address are the valuation the fold runs on

The join between the two halves of the sweep. `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Blocks`
reads an address over a block-major universe as a family of blocks and says how
that family changes along one increment; `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Fold`
says how a quantifier prefix folds along one step of the lexicographic enumeration
of its valuations. They are the same step, and this file says so:

> with the block index type taken to be `Fin n` – which a reduction may simply
> choose, one index per variable of its kernel – the family of blocks
> `DescriptiveComplexity.wmBlk s` **is** a valuation, the value order is
> `DescriptiveComplexity.WMSetLe`, and every hypothesis the fold's three step rules
> ask for is read off `DescriptiveComplexity.wmIncr_lexRel_iff`.

So `DescriptiveComplexity.foldFrom_carry_of_wmIncr` is the fold rule at the carry
index, stated about an address increment and nothing else – the form a program's
step obligation will be discharged in. The blocks after the carry are full before
the step and empty after it, which is exactly the fold's “maximal” and “minimal”
hypotheses (`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLe_of_full`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLe_of_empty`), and the successor hypothesis is
`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLt_iff_of_wmIncr` read through
`DescriptiveComplexity.wmLt_wmSetLe_iff`.
