# CVP is `PTIME`-hard

The reduction, and the hardness it discharges. Three steps:

* the **certificate**, on the source side: a Horn instance fails to be a
  yes-instance exactly when it is not Horn or some goal clause has all its
  negative literals forced (`DescriptiveComplexity.CvpVal.not_hornSatisfiable_iff_glVal`),
  which is `DescriptiveComplexity.exists_goalClause` in one direction and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.forced_subset_model` in the other;
* the **circuit**, on the target side: the drawn circuit accepts exactly when
  the value of its output gate – the top of the goal chain – holds, which is
  the two halves of `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Cvp.Hardness.Value` put
  together;
* the **complement**, on the class side: what the reduction gives is hardness
  of `CVP` for `HORNSAT`ᶜ, and polynomial time is closed under complement
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable.compl`), so complementing the
  Horn discharge turns that into hardness for every problem of the class.

Reducing from the complement is what keeps the circuit monotone: a circuit
reporting *satisfiability* would have to negate the propagation, while one
reporting failure only has to detect a falsified goal clause.
