# 1-in-SAT is NP-complete

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.OneInSAT`, exactly-one satisfiability,
deriving NP-completeness from

* `DescriptiveComplexity.oneInSat_sigmaSODefinable`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.OneInSat.Defs`): membership, by guessing the
  assignment and checking that every clause has a true literal – SAT's kernel –
  and no second one;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.OneInRed.threeSat_ordered_fo_reduction_oneInSat`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.OneInSat.Reduction`): hardness, from the
  NP-hardness of 3SAT, and so ultimately from the Cook–Levin theorem, with no
  machine model anywhere.

The gadget normalizes every clause to three *slots*
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.OneInSat.Slots`), which is what lets one uniform
construction handle clauses of width 0, 1, 2 and 3 at once.
