# REACH is NL-complete

The FO(TC) discharge: every `DescriptiveComplexity.TCDefinable` problem admits an
ordered first-order reduction to `DescriptiveComplexity.REACH`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.reach_hard_of_tcDefinable`). With `REACH ∈ NL`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.reach_mem_NL`) and `NL = FO(TC)`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.tcDefinable_iff_mem_NL`) this closes REACH's completeness for
`DescriptiveComplexity.NL` (`DescriptiveComplexity.REACH_NL_complete`) – directed
`s`-`t` reachability being *the* canonical NL-complete problem ([Jones
1975][jones1975space]; [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive], ch. 3).

## The reduction is the walk itself

Where the discharges of the clausal fragments have to *emit* an instance –
one propositional clause per clause of the program and per instantiation of
its universally quantified variables – the discharge into REACH has nothing to
build: the graph of the walk of a `DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec` already *is* a
marked graph, and reachability in it is what the specification accepts by
definition.

The fit is exact, and it is the tags that make it so. A `TCSpec` walks on
nodes that are a mode together with a `k`-tuple
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.Node`), which is literally the universe
`Tag × A^dim` of a tagged interpretation
(`DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.Map`) at `Tag := spec.Mode` and
`dim := spec.k`. So the interpretation

```
   edge((m, x̄), (m', ȳ))  :=  step m m' (x̄, ȳ)
   source((m, x̄))         :=  src m x̄
   target((m, x̄))         :=  tgt m x̄
```

is nothing but the specification's three formulas, relabeled from their
`Fin k ⊕ Fin k` (resp. `Fin k`) variables to the argument-major variables
`Fin n × Fin k` an interpretation uses. There is no junk to gate away: *every*
tagged tuple is a genuine node of the walk, so an ordinary (unrelativized)
ordered reduction suffices.

One wrinkle: a reduction must map nonempty structures to nonempty structures,
so its tag type must be nonempty, while a `TCSpec` may perfectly well have no
modes at all (and then accept nothing). `DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.pad`, already
at hand from the complementation proof, adds one spare isolated mode and
changes no acceptance, which is exactly the fix.

## What this does *not* claim

As everywhere in this library, no machine model is involved: `NL` is *defined*
by the Krom fragment (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOKromDefinable`), and the
NL-hardness proved here is hardness for that class. Grädel's capture theorem
against logarithmic-space machines ([Grädel 1992][gradel1992capturing]) is not
formalized. Note also how much of the library this one-page reduction rests
on: `REACH ∈ NL` is Immerman–Szelepcsényi, and the passage from an SO-Krom
definition to an FO(TC) one is the translation of
`DescriptiveComplexity.KromTransitiveClosure`.
