# Faithful encodings, for counting problems

`DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding` bundles a concrete instance type with its
encoding as a structure and the two size bounds that keep the encoding honest.
Its semantic obligation, `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.Faithful`, is stated
for decision problems. This file states it for counting problems:
`DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.CountFaithful` asks the abstract counting
problem to return, on every encoded instance, the number the concrete
definition returns. The encoding itself, with its size bounds and its
computability, is the same object. The converse direction has its counting
form too: `DescriptiveComplexity.CountDecoding`, a computable decoder whose
decoded instances have the count of the structure they come from.
