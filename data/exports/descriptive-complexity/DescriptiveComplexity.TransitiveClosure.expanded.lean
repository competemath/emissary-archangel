# FO(TC): first-order logic with transitive closure

The logic that captures nondeterministic logarithmic space on ordered
structures ([Immerman 1987][immerman1987languages]): first-order logic extended
with a *transitive-closure* operator. If `φ(x̄, ȳ)` defines a binary relation on
`k`-tuples, then `TC[x̄, ȳ. φ](ū, v̄)` says that `v̄` is reachable from `ū` in the
`φ`-graph.

## The operator as data

As everywhere in this library, the operator is *not* added to Mathlib's
`FirstOrder.Language.BoundedFormula` as a new constructor – that would mean
redoing relabeling, substitution and realization for an extended syntax, and
losing every existing lemma. It is kept at the Lean level instead: a
`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec` bundles the arity `k`, a *first-order* transition
formula over the ordered expansion with two `k`-tuples of free variables, and
the two endpoint formulas; reachability itself is `Relation.ReflTransGen`,
whose induction principles then do the work in proofs. This is the same move as
`DescriptiveComplexity.HornProgram` for SO-Horn and `DescriptiveComplexity.KromProgram` for
SO-Krom.

A single application of `TC` in front of a first-order matrix is not a
restriction on ordered structures: Immerman's normal form makes every
FO(posTC) formula equivalent to one, just as a single existential block
suffices for `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable`. The library takes that normal
form as the *definition* (`DescriptiveComplexity.TCDefinable`), exactly as it takes
`Σ₁`-definability as the definition of NP rather than proving Fagin's theorem
against a machine.

## What this is for

`DescriptiveComplexity.NL` is already defined, by the Krom fragment
(`DescriptiveComplexity.LogSpace`), and the two coincide
(`DescriptiveComplexity.tcDefinable_iff_mem_NL`), so FO(TC) is not set up as a
second complexity class; the modes are what would make that possible, should it
become useful. A walk whose state were only a tuple of elements could not be
pulled back through an interpretation, whose tags vary from node to node, and
could not carry the finite data a translation needs (the atom index and sign of
a literal, say); carrying it in coordinates would fail on a one-element
universe. FO(TC) is here as the logic in which two things are naturally stated:

* the translation to the Krom fragment, which goes through the *complement* –
  a clausal fragment states closure and rejection, so it defines
  non-reachability head-on, exactly as `DescriptiveComplexity.unreach_mem_NL` does for
  the concrete case;
* **Immerman–Szelepcsényi**, closure of FO(TC) under complement
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.TCDefinable.compl` in
  `DescriptiveComplexity.TransitiveClosureCompl`), whose inductive-counting proof is a
  walk on configurations – a phase, a flag and eight registers, each a node or
  a count – and so lives inside a single `TC`. That theorem turns the above
  translation into an equivalence and gives `REACH ∈ NL`.

The canonical example is `DescriptiveComplexity.reach_tcDefinable` – REACH *is* a `TC`,
at arity one and with a single mode, over the edge relation between the marked
sources and the marked targets.
