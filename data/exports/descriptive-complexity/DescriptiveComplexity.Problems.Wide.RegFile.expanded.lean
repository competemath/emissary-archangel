# What a register file has to be

A wide machine cannot read the digits of the address it is on, so every program
for one keeps a **register file**: one recognizable cell per element of the
instance, holding one bit of a track. The walks, the tests and the mirror ask
four things of that file and nothing else:

> stand on the cell of `u`, write there, move to the cell of the next element,
> recognize the two ends.

This file says what a family of cells has to satisfy for those four to work, and
the answer is short: it has to be **strictly monotone**, and no register may be
the empty address.

The index is arbitrary. A space-bounded program's file has one register per
element and that is what `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile` names, but a program
that has to *lay its file out* on a clock cannot afford that index – a rule sees
the control and the cell under the head and nothing else, so the only addresses
it can locate are a fixed number of tuple roll-overs from where it starts, and
the elements are more. `DescriptiveComplexity.IxFile` is therefore the interface
at an arbitrary ordered index, and `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile` is its
diagonal case (`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.toIx`), every elementwise
statement below being the general one read there. Two linear orders are in play
in the general form and only one at the diagonal: that of the **addresses**,
over which the cells are compared, and that of the **index**, in which the
registers are laid out.

* Monotonicity gives injectivity (`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.injective`) and
  the converse comparison (`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.lt_iff`), so the file is
  ordered exactly like the instance and a walk recovers the order and nothing
  else. It also gives the fact that turns a move between consecutive registers
  into a single scan: **nothing is a register between two consecutive ones**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.gap`), so the scan cannot overshoot or stop
  early.
* Nonemptiness of a cell (`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.cell_nonempty`) is what
  lets the head step *below* the first register, which is where a downward pass
  ends.

Two files satisfy this. The one a space-bounded program uses is the ladder the
input channel marks – `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSegFile`, whose cell for `x` is the
initial segment `{y | y ≤ x}` – and it is free, being in the instance before any
transition is written. It is also, as `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Marks`
explains, a geometric ruler lying in the top half of the tape, which a clocked
program cannot afford to walk twice. A clocked program therefore builds its own
file low on the tape and instantiates the same walks at it: that is what this
interface is for, and why the walks above it name a `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile`
rather than `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSeg`.

/-! ### An ordered index, its successors and its ranks

Everything a register walk asks of a file is about the order its cells are laid
out in, and nothing about *what* indexes them. The index of the file a
space-bounded program uses is the instance itself, which is why the elementwise
names below read as “per element”; a program that has to lay its file out on a
clock cannot afford that index, so the general form comes first and the
elementwise one is its diagonal. -/

/-! ### The interface, at an arbitrary index

A file is a family of addresses indexed by something ordered, and the four
things a walk asks of it are about that order alone. The index of the file a
space-bounded program uses is the instance itself, which is why the interface
below reads as “one cell per element”; a program that has to *lay its file out*
on a clock cannot afford that index – it can only locate a fixed number of tuple
roll-overs from where it starts, and the elements are more – so the interface is
stated at an arbitrary ordered index and the elementwise one is its diagonal
case.

Two linear orders are in play and they are not the same: the one of the
**addresses** (`DescriptiveComplexity.WMLe`, over which the cells are compared)
and the one of the **index** (which says in what order the registers are laid
out). At the diagonal they coincide, which is why the elementwise statements
below take one hypothesis where the general ones take two. -/
