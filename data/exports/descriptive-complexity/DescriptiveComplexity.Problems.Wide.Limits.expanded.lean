# What a wide machine cannot do: name its own elements

A wide machine's *positions* are the addresses of its universe – the sets of
elements – and the only way a program has of recording one is a **register
file**: a stretch of consecutive cells, one register per element, each holding
one bit of the address. A file that is to be *faithful*, i.e., to tell two
addresses apart the way a scan of it does
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ixAddr_ixMark`), needs one register per element, and its
registers have to be told apart by the **names** the file records at them
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Layout.NameSep`).

The theorem below is the counting fact that follows, and it is what forbids a
program from *laying* such a file. A state's payload carries one element of the
universe's base type per control flag **and** one per slot, all inside a
`dd`-tuple – that is `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog.payload_le` – so the
control's value space is `|A| ^ #flags` with `#flags < dd`, while the elements
number `|Tag| · |A| ^ dd`. **The control cannot hold a name that separates the
registers**, and a sweep laying a file has nowhere else to hold one: at the cell
it is about to write, the region is blank, and no rule can read the head's
address.

So a clocked program cannot build its own register file over its own universe,
however the file is indexed and however wide the reduction makes the dimension:
the two constraints move together. What is left to a program is a file it is
*handed* – the input channel's, whose geometry is the model's
(`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSeg`) and not the reduction's – or an evaluation that
never records an address at all.

/-- **A wide machine's control has fewer values than the universe has
elements**: the payload of a state holds one element per control flag and one
per slot inside a `dd`-tuple, so the flags are strictly fewer than `dd` as soon
as there is one slot, and the elements are at least `|A| ^ dd`.

This is the counting behind the rule that a program's register file comes from
its input channel or not at all (stated in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide`): a program that lays a register file has
to write, at each register, a name that separates it from the others, and the
only place a name can come from is the control. -/
