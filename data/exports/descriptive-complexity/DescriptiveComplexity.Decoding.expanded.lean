# Well-formed instances and computable decodings

The decoding direction of an encoding (`DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding`):
membership results transfer to the concrete problem along a faithful encoding
for free, but reading a *hardness* theorem back to concrete data needs a
converse – the abstract problem must not be hard only on junk structures the
encoding never produces. This file makes that converse checkable, in two
independent, composable pieces designed to keep the user-facing work minimal.

**Well-formedness is a decision problem.** The junk-free structures are cut
out by an isomorphism-invariant property `W` – typically a plain first-order
sentence, bundled by `DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem.ofSentence` so that
invariance comes for free. Hardness *on well-formed instances* then needs no
new framework at all: it is ordinary hardness of the conjunction `W ⊓ P`
(pointwise `∧`, the `Min` instance below), and the library's existing
machinery applies to it unchanged. A user upgrades an existing completeness
proof with two one-liners:

* **hardness**: a reduction into `P` whose images are all well-formed is a
  reduction into `W ⊓ P` –
  `DescriptiveComplexity.FOReduction.withInvariant` /
  `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedFOReduction.withInvariant` turn the existing
  reduction plus an image lemma into the strengthened one;
* **membership**: `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable.inf_ofSentence`
  conjoins the sentence `W` into the existing `Σ₁` kernel.

The choice of `W` is self-policing: chosen too narrow, the hardness reduction
cannot land in it; chosen too wide, the decoding below cannot handle it.
Both failure modes are proofs that do not close, never silent unsoundness.

**Decodings are computations.** An *existential* decoding statement
(`∀ A, ∃ i, Conc i ↔ P A`) is classically near-vacuous:
casing on `P A` discharges it with no decoding whatsoever, whenever the
concrete type has one yes- and one no-instance. The honest content is a
*function*, so `DescriptiveComplexity.Decoding` bundles one, with the same
computability hygiene as encoders: a plain `def`

* `dec : FinPresentation L → Option ι` – from concretely presented finite
  structures (`DescriptiveComplexity.FinPresentation`: a size and a `Bool`-valued
  relation table) to concrete instances, `none` *being* the junk case, so no
  proof-carrying arguments and no partiality tricks;
* `sound` – whatever `dec` returns is decided by `Conc` exactly as the
  presented structure is by `P`;
* `total` – on well-formed (nonempty) presentations, `dec` returns something.

Because `dec` is `Option`-valued and computable, it can be *run*: `#guard`s
can test a decoder on small presentations exactly as they test encoders, and
the compiler rejects a decoder whose data decides an undecidable predicate.
The residual gap is also the same as for encoders: computability is enforced,
a *complexity bound* is not (a decoder may brute-force the answer), since
stating one means measuring the decoder against a machine model, which this
interface does not do.

The `Prop`-level consequence – every well-formed finite structure is
semantically a concrete instance – is
`DescriptiveComplexity.Decoding.exists_conc_iff`; unlike its removed
predecessor it cannot be established by classical casing, because it is
derived from the bundled function.

Worked decoders are in the two tutorials
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Examples.ConjunctiveQueries`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.Examples.GraphCrawling`); the crawling one exists only
thanks to well-formedness – on structures marking several roots no honest
decoder can choose without computing reachability, and `W` (“exactly one
root”) is what removes them. `DescriptiveComplexity.bwDecoding`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.BinarySubsetSum`) is the opposite extreme,
`W` being `⊤`: a binary-weighted structure whose order is not linear is a
definite no-instance, so a concrete no-instance decodes it and there is
nothing to exclude.

## Main declarations

* `DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem.ofSentence`: a first-order sentence
  as a decision problem, the usual shape of a well-formedness condition;
* the `Min` instance on `DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem`, giving the
  restriction `W ⊓ P`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.FOReduction.withInvariant` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedFOReduction.withInvariant`: strengthen a
  reduction's target by an invariant its images satisfy;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable.inf_ofSentence`: conjoin a
  first-order sentence into a `Σₖ` definition;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.Faithful.inf`: encoded instances that are
  well-formed are faithful for the restricted problem;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.FinPresentation` and `DescriptiveComplexity.Decoding`:
  concretely presented structures and computable decodings, with
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Decoding.exists_conc_iff` as the `Prop`-level
  consequence.
