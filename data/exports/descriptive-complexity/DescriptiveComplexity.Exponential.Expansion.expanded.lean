# Exponential expansions: reading a structure over its second-order objects

The one construction the exponential classes are built from. An **exponential
expansion** of `L`-structures maps a finite ordered `L`-structure `A` to a
structure over another vocabulary `E` whose *universe is a definable set of
tagged assignments of a second-order block*. A block with a variable of arity
`a` has `2^(n^a)` assignments on a universe of size `n`, so the expanded
universe is exponentially larger than `A`, and a resource bound read there is
one exponential higher than the same bound read on `A`.

The data (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion`) mirrors
`DescriptiveComplexity.RelFOInterpretation` one level up:

* a finite `Tag` type and a block `B`, whose pairs `(t, ρ)` are the candidate
  points – the analogue of the tagged tuples `Tag × A^dim`;
* a **domain sentence** `dom t` per tag, over the ordered base vocabulary
  expanded by one copy of the block, cutting the universe down to a definable
  set (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.Map`, a subtype);
* a **defining sentence** `relSentence r τ` per relation symbol of `E` and per
  tuple of tags, over the ordered base vocabulary expanded by as many copies of
  the block as the symbol has arguments
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.replicate`).

Three design points, each paying for itself downstream.

**The tags are part of the data, not a separate dimension.** A `d`-tuple of
points is a tag tuple together with an assignment of the replicated block, so
composing an expansion with a first-order interpretation gives an expansion
again, exactly rather than up to an embedding
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Exponential.Pull`). Without the tag factor every
hardness discharge would owe a relativization argument.

**There is a domain sentence.** Hardness in this library is cofinal hardness
and `DescriptiveComplexity.cofinalHard_iff` hands out *relativized* reductions
`≤ʳᶠᵒ[≤]`, whose target universe is already a subtype; an expansion composed
with one is again an expansion only if expansions may carve out their universe
too. `dom_nonempty` is then the same obligation, for the same reason, as in
`DescriptiveComplexity.RelOrderedFOReduction`.

**The sentences see the order, the problem does not.** This is the discipline
of `DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec`: the capture theorems this development
builds on are the ordered ones, while order-invariance is what makes the notion
a `DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem`.
