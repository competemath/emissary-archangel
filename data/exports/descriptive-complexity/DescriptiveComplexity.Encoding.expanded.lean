# Faithful encodings of concrete instance types

A `DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem` is a property of finite structures. A
user of the library starts elsewhere: from *concrete data* – a list of atoms, a
family of weights – which must be encoded as a structure before any theorem of
the library applies. That encoding step carries two obligations:

1. **semantic equivalence** – the abstract semantics on the encoded structure
   agrees with the textbook semantics of the concrete data; and
2. **representation faithfulness** – the encoded structure is of the right
   *size*. Get this wrong and the complexity result is about a different
   computational problem, however faithfully its meaning matches: encode a
   number in unary (as the cardinality of a marked set) when the honest size
   counts its bit length, and a subset-sum instance sits on a universe
   exponential in its own size, so its NP-hardness silently evaporates.

This file makes obligation 2 a *proof obligation*: `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding`
bundles the concrete instance type, its declared size, the encoding map, and
polynomial bounds in **both** directions between the declared size and the
cardinality of the encoded universe – so that an encoding cannot be constructed
without discharging them. `card_le` forbids padding (protecting membership
claims: pad the universe to `2 ^ size` and “in NP over structures” becomes a
much weaker statement about the concrete problem); `le_card` forbids
compression (protecting hardness claims), and also defends the definition
against inflating `size` to make `card_le` vacuous. Obligation 1 remains a
theorem the user proves, now packaged as `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.Faithful`.

The bounds compare the declared size with `Nat.card` of the universe rather
than with a bit size: the vocabulary is fixed and of fixed arity, so a
structure on `n` elements takes `Θ(n ^ r)` bits – cardinality and bit size are
polynomially related, and the criterion is polynomial.

## Hygiene: computability, enforced

The relations of an encoding are `Bool`-valued (`relBool`), and the
`FirstOrder.Language.Structure` instance on the universe is *derived* from
them, not supplied: an encoder is a computation, not an arbitrary `Prop`. This
is enforced by the compiler rather than by convention – a definition whose
*data* decides an undecidable predicate must be marked `noncomputable`, so the
check to run on an encoder is simply **“its `relBool` elaborates as a plain
`def`, with no `noncomputable` marker”**. Together with the `DecidableEq` and
`Fintype` fields this makes an encoding genuinely executable: an encoded
structure can be `#eval`-ed on a small instance and *tested* before anything is
proved about it.

Do not run `#print axioms` on a bundled `Encoding` to check its encoder:
proof fields are erased by the compiler but not by `#print axioms`, so the
bound proofs (which typically use classical axioms through `Nat.card`) mask
the report. The axiom report is only informative on a standalone `relBool`
definition – and even there “no axioms” is the expected answer only for
quotient-free data: an encoder deciding `Finset` membership goes through
`Multiset` quotients, whose `Decidable` instances cite the classical axioms
in proof positions without affecting executability. The reliable checks are
the two the compiler and evaluator give: no `noncomputable` marker, and a
`#guard`/`#eval` that actually reduces.

## What this does not buy

Nothing here rules out an encoder that *computes the answer*: encode a SAT
instance on a universe of the right size with one unary predicate marking an
element iff the formula is satisfiable, and take the problem “some element is
marked”. Both bounds hold, `Faithful` is provable, and the problem is even
FO-definable; the illegitimacy is entirely in the computational power the
encoder used. Computability of the encoder is enforced, a *complexity bound*
on it is not: stating one means measuring the encoder against a machine model,
which this interface does not do. The reader of an encoding is therefore told
exactly which of the two obligations is machine-checked and which requires
reading `relBool`.

## The decoding direction

Membership results transfer to the concrete problem along a faithful encoding;
*hardness* results need a converse – the abstract problem must not be hard
only on junk structures the encoding never produces. The machinery for that
converse lives in `DescriptiveComplexity/Decoding.lean`: well-formedness as a
decision problem (restricting hardness to `W ⊓ P`) and computable decodings
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Decoding`), with the same hygiene as the encoders
here. `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.Covers` below is the ideal,
isomorphism-based decoding statement; junk conventions usually make it
unprovable for honest encodings, which is exactly what the well-formedness
route is for.

## Main declarations

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding`: the bundled encoding, with its two size
  bounds;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.str`: the derived structure on an encoded
  universe;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.Faithful`: obligation 1, semantic
  equivalence with a concrete predicate;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.Covers`: the ideal, isomorphism-based
  decoding statement (see `DescriptiveComplexity/Decoding.lean` for the
  practical route);
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding.linear_bound`: discharge a bound field from a
  linear estimate, the common case.

A worked example – the packaged conjunctive-query instances – is in
`DescriptiveComplexity/Examples/ConjunctiveQueries.lean`; a second one, for a
catalog problem whose numbers must be written in binary, is
`DescriptiveComplexity/Encoding/BinarySubsetSum.lean`, which encodes a list of
weights and a target and proves the encoding faithful for Knapsack. The
theorem that the size bounds have teeth (no unary encoding of subset-sum
satisfies them) is in `DescriptiveComplexity/Encoding/UnaryBlowup.lean`.
