# SO-Horn: existential second-order logic with a Horn kernel

The fragment SO-Horn of Grädel ([Grädel 1992][gradel1992capturing]): existential
second-order sentences whose first-order kernel is a conjunction of *Horn
clauses* in the quantified relation variables. On ordered structures SO-Horn
captures polynomial time – the Horn kernel is exactly what makes the guessed
relations *determined* rather than merely guessed, since a satisfiable Horn
formula has a least model, computable by unit propagation.

## The kernel, as data

The Horn condition constrains only the occurrences of the *second-order*
variables: a clause is

```
guard(x̄) ∧ R₁(x̄) ∧ … ∧ Rₙ(x̄) → R₀(x̄)   (or → ⊥)
```

where `guard` is an arbitrary first-order formula over the *input* vocabulary
alone (in the definability notion below, over its ordered expansion). Rather
than carve this shape out of `FirstOrder.Language.BoundedFormula` with a
syntactic predicate, the kernel is represented here *as data*: a
`DescriptiveComplexity.HornClause` bundles its guard, the list of its body atoms and its
optional head atom, and a `DescriptiveComplexity.HornProgram` is a list of clauses
sharing `k` universally quantified first-order variables. This is Grädel's
clausal normal form, and it is what a reduction consuming an SO-Horn definition
needs to see: the discharge of `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.HornSat.Hardness` reads the
clause list directly, and emits one propositional Horn clause per clause and
per instantiation of the `k` variables.

`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable` is the resulting definability notion,
the SO-Horn analogue of `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable`; it is closed under
(ordered) first-order reductions by
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderHornPull`, which is what makes it a
`DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass` – the class `DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME` of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Hierarchy`.

/-- A decision problem is *SO-Horn definable* if, on nonempty finite *ordered*
structures, it is defined by an existential second-order sentence with a Horn
kernel: there is a block of relation variables and a Horn program over the
ordered expansion of the vocabulary such that the yes-instances are exactly
the structures admitting a satisfying assignment.

This is the SO-Horn analogue of `DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSODefinable`; a single
block suffices, since existential second-order quantifiers merge.

The guards live over `L.sum Language.order`, and the equivalence is required
for *every* linear order on `A`, exactly as in
`DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedFOReduction`: since the problem itself does not see the
order, this is order-invariant SO-Horn definability. The order is not a
convenience here – it is the setting of Grädel's capture theorem, it is what
lets a Horn program traverse an unbounded conjunction along the order, and it
is forced by closure under ordered first-order reductions
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable.of_orderedReduction`), which pull the
lexicographic order of the interpreted universe back into the guards. Nor can
the order be guessed away, as it is for the existential logics and – see
`DescriptiveComplexity.sotcDefinable_iff_free` – for SO(TC): a Horn kernel
cannot state that a guessed relation is total, two positive literals in one
clause not being Horn. -/
