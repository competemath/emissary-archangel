# The cells a wide machine can recognize

A wide machine cannot read the digits of the address it is on, so a program
needs cells it can *identify by their contents*. The vocabulary gives it exactly
`n` of them, for free, through the input channel:

> `wmInp x a` puts the symbol `a` in the cell at the address `{y | y ≤ x}`, the
> **initial segment** cut by `x`, and every other cell starts blank.

So a reduction that writes a mark in every element's cell obtains `n`
distinguished cells, spread through the tape in the instance's own order
(`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLt_wmSeg`), findable by scanning
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Roam`) and reusable as the machine's
**register file**: one tape track over these `n` cells is one `n`-bit register,
and an `n`-bit register is a *mirror* of an address – the thing the head cannot
read off itself.

**The marks cannot all be different, and need not be.** A symbol *is* an element
and there is one register per element, so distinct names would need as many
symbols as elements, leaving none to be the blank – and the blank must differ from
every mark, or a blank cell of the working area would stop a scan looking for a
register. What a program actually needs is far less: the walks of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Walk` carry their pointer in the *control*
and only ever ask “is this cell a register?”, so one generic mark serves them all.
Only the two ends of the file have to be recognized on sight – to begin a downward
pass and to come back from one – and two distinguished symbols pay for that.

This file says what those cells are and where they sit:

| fact | theorem |
|---|---|
| the marked cell of an element | `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSeg` |
| an address is a cell exactly when it is a segment | `DescriptiveComplexity.wmDown_iff_eq_wmSeg` |
| they are ordered like the elements | `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLt_wmSeg_iff` |
| nothing is marked between consecutive ones | `DescriptiveComplexity.not_wmSeg_between` |
| distinct elements mark distinct cells | `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSeg_injective` |
| the head does not start on one | `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLt_empty_wmSeg` |
| they all sit above the working area | `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSetLt_wmSeg_of_not_bot` |
| the working area is the interval below them | `DescriptiveComplexity.wmIncr_wmWorkTop` |
| a marked cell holds its symbol at time zero | `DescriptiveComplexity.initTape_wmSeg` |
| every other cell starts blank | `DescriptiveComplexity.initTape_of_not_wmDown` |
| the initial configuration, marks and all | `DescriptiveComplexity.isInit_wide_marks` |

Nothing here is about a program: these are facts about the vocabulary, settled
before any transition table is written.

The least element of the instance is the **most significant** digit of an address
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Increment`), and every marked cell contains
it. So the register file sits entirely in the upper half of the tape and the
addresses that do *not* contain the least element – the **working area**, half the
tape, exponentially many cells – lie below every register. A program's data
therefore cannot collide with its registers: it reaches the file by scanning
right and comes back by scanning left. -/
