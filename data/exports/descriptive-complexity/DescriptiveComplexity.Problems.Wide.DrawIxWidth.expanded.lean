# The evaluation's width is polynomial

The clock of the wide machines compares a *product*: the evaluation is charged
`a * b` with `a` a width and `b` a number of rounds, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Data.nexTotal_lt_two_pow'` asks for each factor
below `2 ^ (k * m)`. The rounds are bounded elsewhere: the VAL loop is an
increment chain, injective into the subsets of the registers it is supported
on. This file bounds the other factor, the width
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Data.ixLegWidth` times the number of spine
positions.

Every layer's cost – an atom's, a matrix's, a gate block's, a round's, a
variable's machinery's, a leg's – is built from the widths the legs are charged
against and from the file's own numbers by addition and multiplication alone. So
each is *polynomial* in a single bound `q` on all of them, and the bound proved
here is `q ^ 25`: crude, and deliberately so, since what an instantiation has to
show is `q ^ 25 ≤ 2 ^ (k * m)` with `q` polynomial in the drawn universe and `m`
its size – room the exponent does not eat into.

The three combinators (`add_le_pow`, `mul_le_pow`, `le_pow_of_le`) are the whole
method: a sum of two things below `q ^ i` is below `q ^ (i + 1)` because `q` is
at least two, and a product adds the exponents. Written that way, each layer's
bound is one line per node of its defining expression. The target exponent of a
raised or constant bound is written explicitly, since neither the goal nor the
argument determines it.

the spine's width, times its number of positions, is below `q ^ 25` whenever `q`

arities.

This is the first of the two factors the clocked evaluation is charged
