# Immerman–Szelepcsényi: `NL = coNL`

**The theorem** ([Immerman 1988][immerman1988nondeterministic], [Szelepcsényi
1988][szelepcsenyi1988method]): nondeterministic logarithmic space is closed
under complement. In this library the class NL is *defined* by the Krom
fragment of existential second-order logic
(`DescriptiveComplexity.NL`), and the theorem is assembled from three pieces:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.TCDefinable.compl` – FO(TC) is closed under complement, the
  content of the theorem, proved by the inductive-counting machine of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.InductiveCounting` run inside a single transitive closure
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.TransitiveClosureCompl`);
* the two translations between the Krom fragment and FO(TC), which say that
  SO-Krom definability is FO(TC) definability *of the complement*
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.sigmaSOKromDefinable_iff_tcDefinable_compl`);
* the definitional duality between a class and its complement class.

Three consequences are recorded here beyond `NL = coNL` itself: NL *is* FO(TC)
(`DescriptiveComplexity.tcDefinable_iff_mem_NL`), which the two translations alone
could not say; the Krom fragment is closed under complement, which no
inspection of clauses could give; and `REACH ∈ NL`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.reach_mem_NL`), the membership a clausal fragment cannot state
directly because it defines non-reachability head-on.

/-- **Immerman–Szelepcsényi**: on finite ordered structures, the complement of
an FO(TC) definable problem is FO(TC) definable.

The specification of the complement is the inductive-counting machine: its
modes are the control states (a phase, one flag and the mode of each of eight
registers) and its tuples hold the eight registers side by side, so that
counting the nodes of every layer of the given walk – and certifying, at the
last layer, that no accepting node was ever counted in – is itself one walk.
