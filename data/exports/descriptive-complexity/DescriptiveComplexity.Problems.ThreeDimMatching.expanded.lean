# 3-dimensional matching

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.ThreeDimMatching`, Karp's 3-DIMENSIONAL
MATCHING – do some of the available triples cover every marked element exactly
once? – on the vocabulary `FirstOrder.Language.tripleSys` of three marked
classes and a ternary relation.

It collects the definition and its isomorphism-invariance, the membership half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.threeDimMatching_mem_NP`) – a matching *is* a relation, so
the certificate guesses it and the kernel spells out “inside the classes,
everything covered, nothing twice” – and the hardness half
(`DescriptiveComplexity.sat_ordered_fo_reduction_threeDimMatching`), Karp's reduction
from SAT: a truth-setting gadget running **cyclically** through the
occurrences of each variable, a pair per clause coverable only through the tip
of a true literal, and one garbage pair per occurrence that is not the first
of its clause – exactly as many as there are tips left over.
