# Writing an expansion's sentences with iterated block expansions

An exponential expansion defines an `n`-ary symbol by a sentence over the base
vocabulary expanded by `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.replicate` – *one* block
holding `n` copies. The rest of the library writes its multi-state sentences
over *iterated* expansions instead: one copy of `B.lang` per state, stacked as
nested sums (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.structure₁`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.structure₂` – the shape of an
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec`).

This file bridges the two presentations at the arities an expansion actually
needs, one and two:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.oneLHom` reads a sentence over `L ⊕ B.lang`
  inside `L ⊕ (B.replicate 1).lang`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.twoLHom` reads a sentence over
  `(L ⊕ B.lang) ⊕ B.lang` inside `L ⊕ (B.replicate 2).lang`, the first copy
  becoming copy `0` and the second copy `1`.

Both transports are definitional on assignments – reading copy `k` of a
replicated assignment *is* reading the `k`-th assignment – so their correctness
lemmas are `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.realize_homSentence` and one
`LHom.IsExpansionOn` whose relation case is `rfl`.

/-! ### Two copies, the other way

`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.twoLHom` reads a *stacked* sentence inside a
replicated one, which is what an expansion's defining sentence needs. A walk
over an expanded universe needs the converse: an
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec` states its transition over two stacked copies
of its state block, while everything said about two points of an expanded
universe – their order, their equality, one being the successor of the other –
is written over the block replicated twice. -/
