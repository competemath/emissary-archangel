# The operator pinned: `PSPACE = NL.exp`

The check on `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass.exp` at the one level where
this library independently knows the answer, in **both** directions.
`DescriptiveComplexity.PSPACE_subset_NL_exp` is the easy half: an
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec` *is* the graph REACH reads on the expansion
whose points are its states. This file closes the converse, so that the operator
is pinned rather than merely bounded.

## The route

Nondeterministic logarithmic space read over an expanded universe is *machine*
space, and the machine is the one the library already captures
(`DescriptiveComplexity.tcDefinable_iff_automaton`): a finite control with `k`
two-way heads, each holding one point of the expansion. Three steps:

1. the walk witnessing `Q ∈ NL` is carried to the **trivialized** expansion
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.relSpec`), where every tagged assignment
   is a point and the old universe survives as a mark – so that a head's
   `succ` is the plain binary increment and never has to skip anything;
2. that walk is compiled into a two-way multi-head automaton
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.accepts_drvP`), whose tests are **quantifier-free by
   fiat**;
3. the automaton is simulated by a walk over the *base*
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.autoSpec`), a configuration being one
   assignment of one block.

Nothing in the chain evaluates a quantifier ranging over the expanded universe,
which is exactly the obstruction the translation lemma names.

## What is and is not a corollary

`LOGSPACE.exp ⊆ PSPACE` follows by monotonicity. The reverse inclusion does
**not**: `DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCDefinable.expDefinable` draws the graph of a
walk and then asks REACH of it, and REACH is not known to this library to be in
`DescriptiveComplexity.LOGSPACE`. `LOGSPACE.exp = PSPACE` would need the walk of
the expansion to be *functional* – a deterministic reachability argument, i.e.,
Savitch read one exponential up – and is not claimed here.
