# The six questions a machine playing a second-order game must answer

`DescriptiveComplexity.Exponential.AltQuant` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Exponential.BlockClaim` are the two normal forms; this
file applies them to an `DescriptiveComplexity.SOGameSpec` and packages the
result as the interface a machine consumes.

## The six questions

A machine playing the game of a specification has to decide six sentences, not
four: the three one-copy sentences `won`, `univ`, `start`, the two-copy
sentence `move`, and the **negations** of `univ` and of `move`. The negations
are not a redundancy – a sentence is always used in the positive direction, an
existential branch that *proves* it and gets stuck otherwise, so refuting one
means proving another (`DescriptiveComplexity.GameQuestion`).

`DescriptiveComplexity.SOGameSpec.question` reads all six in the *same*
language, the two-copy one, the one-copy sentences traveling along
`FirstOrder.Language.LHom.sumInl`; that uniformity is what lets the machine's
tag be a plain product rather than a dependent sum.

## What the interface says

`DescriptiveComplexity.QuestionData` is what the machine's control needs about
one question:

* `vars` and `pol` – the length of the alternating prefix and whose turn each
  variable is, so a prefix phase is an index and a tuple coordinate;
* `atoms` – the occurrences of block atoms in the matrix, each an *address* on
  the tape;
* `sub` – for each vector of claimed truth values, the residual formula over
  the **base** vocabulary, which the interpretation writes into a transition
  guard.

`DescriptiveComplexity.QuestionData.Plays` states that this data decides the
sentence, and `DescriptiveComplexity.exists_questionData` produces it. The
matrix condition is stated as
`DescriptiveComplexity.QuestionData.MatrixHolds` – *there is a vector of
correct claims whose residual formula holds* – which is literally the round the
machine plays: the existential player claims the whole vector in one move, the
universal player challenges one claim by a tape lookup or lets the residual
formula be evaluated.
