# Pulling an exponential expansion back through an interpretation

**An interpretation followed by an expansion is an expansion.** Given an
ordered first-order interpretation `I` of `L'` in `L` and an exponential
expansion `X` of `L'`-structures, the composite `A ↦ X.Map (I.Map A)` is again
an exponential expansion of `L`-structures,
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.pullOrdered`. This is what makes
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpDefinable` closed under (ordered) first-order
reductions, hence `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass.exp` a genuine
complexity class; and, read the other way round, it is the formal content of
the side condition the succinctness literature attaches to its upgrade theorem
– that the reduction must act on the *description* rather than on the described
instance.

Three existing pieces do the work, and no new mathematics is needed.

* **The order of the interpreted universe is definable**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.ordExtend`): an expansion's
  sentences see the order of the structure they expand, so pulling them back
  through `I` requires `I` to define that order. It does, lexicographically,
  and `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.ordExtendLEquiv` says the
  extended interpretation produces exactly the interpreted structure with the
  lexicographic order.
* **A block pulls back through an interpretation**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.pull`,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.extendSO`): an `a`-ary relation
  variable on `Tag × A^d` becomes one `(a·d)`-ary relation variable on `A` per
  tuple of tags, and assignments correspond bijectively
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.pullAssignEquiv`).
* **Replication commutes with that pullback**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.homAssign_replicatePullHom`), definitionally,
  which is why the defining sentences of the composite are the pulled ones read
  through a renaming of relation variables and nothing more.

The chain of transports is the one
`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderTransitiveClosurePull` runs for an
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOTCSpec`, stated here over an arbitrary block so that
one lemma – `DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.realize_extendSO_pullSentence`
– serves both the domain sentence (one copy of the block) and every defining
sentence (as many copies as the symbol has arguments).

/-- **The transport lemma.** A sentence over the ordered vocabulary of `L'`
expanded by a block, read in the interpreted universe with the block
interpreted by `ρ`, says in `A` exactly what its pullback says with the pulled
block interpreted by the pulled assignment.

The three steps are the three ingredients of the module docstring: pull the
sentence through the block-extended interpretation, identify the interpreted
structure of the block extension with the block expansion of the interpreted
structure, and identify the order the extended interpretation defines with the
lexicographic order of
`DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.mapLinearOrder`. -/

The pulled expansion has the *same* expanded vocabulary as the original, by
definition; but `DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.pullOrdered` is not
reducible, so the expanded structure has to be named rather than found by
instance search. `DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.pullOrderedStructure` is
that name, and it is the very term a goal about `X.pullOrdered I` elaborates
to. -/
