# Independent copies of a second-order block

An exponential expansion (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion`) defines an
`n`-ary relation on its universe – the assignments of a block `B` – by a
first-order sentence that must read `n` assignments at once. The vocabulary it
is written over is therefore `n` independent copies of `B.lang`, packaged here
as a single block `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.replicate`:

* its relation variables are pairs `(k, i)` of a copy index and a variable of
  `B`, with the arity of `i`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.replicateAssign` assembles one assignment per
  copy into an assignment of the replicated block – exactly, since the
  index type is a plain product;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.replicateSym` names the symbol of copy `k`,
  read back by `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.relMap_replicateSym`.

This is a *product* presentation of a quantifier prefix, as opposed to the
iterated-merge presentation of `DescriptiveComplexity.repMerged`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderReplicate`), which is built by recursion on
`k` and whose index type is a nest of sums. The product presentation is what
this development needs, for one reason: replication **commutes with the
pullback of a block through an interpretation** definitionally
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.homAssign_replicatePullHom`), because both
sides re-associate the same `Σ`-type over a product. Pulling an expansion back
through an interpretation is exactly that re-association, so the commutation is
the lemma `DescriptiveComplexity.Exponential.Pull` rests on, and is proved by
`rfl`.

/-! ### Replication commutes with the pullback through an interpretation

`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.pull` turns an `a`-ary variable on the
interpreted universe `Tag × A^d` into one `(a · d)`-ary variable on `A` per
tuple of tags. Applied to the replicated block it produces variables indexed by
`Σ (k, i), Fin (B.arity i) → Tag`; replicating the pulled block produces
variables indexed by `Fin n × Σ i, Fin (B.arity i) → Tag`. These are the same
data re-associated, with equal arities, so the induced block morphism is an
arity-preserving bijection and the transported assignments agree by `rfl`. -/
