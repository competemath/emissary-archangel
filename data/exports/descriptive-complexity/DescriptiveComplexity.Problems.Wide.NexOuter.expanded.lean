# The clocked program's outer layer

The EXPSPACE program's outer loop (`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.OuterPh`) is an
iteration: startup, then a sweep, a convergence test and a copy-back, round after
round until the fixed point stops moving. A program on a clock cannot iterate –
a partial fixed point may run through doubly exponentially many stages – and it
cannot use the input channel's mark ladder either, since reaching it costs more
than the clock allows. What it does instead is four things once:

1. lay its own register file out, low on the tape, one cell per **block and
   tuple** (`DescriptiveComplexity.blkFile`: one per element is what a clock
   cannot pay for);
2. **guess** the certificate onto the same stretch, one write per address;
3. run the evaluation over the region, exactly the EXPSPACE program's;
4. accept.

This file is that outer layer, with the evaluation abstract – its phase type
`PE`, its site family and its boundary rules are parameters, as in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Data.outerRule` – and with the two sweeps' *writes*
abstract too, because what a cell of the file holds is a fact about the layout
the caller chose and not about the shape of the loop. The runs the two sweeps
discharge against are `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog.reachesIn_buildFile` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog.reachesIn_guessTracks`.

## Why the guess is a shape and not a guard

Every other site here separates in-shape: from the guard and the phase, the rule
that fired is recoverable, which is what the backward reading of a run needs. The
guessing site does not, and must not – its shapes are the certificate's values at
one cell, all of them firing under the same guard. That is the whole
nondeterminism of the program, and `nexSep` states the separation for every other
site, which is what `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.UniqueFrom` asks for.

## Why the two sweeps stop on the control and not on the tape

Both sweeps run right along a stretch whose ends are addresses, and a rule sees
only the control and the cell under the head. The cell cannot say where the
stretch ends – the tape is blank there, and blank is what the cells ahead hold
too – so the stop test is a predicate on the control: the pointer has passed the
file's top. It is the caller's, along with the write and the pointer's advance,
bundled as `SweepSpec`.

## Why the block is in the phase and the tuple in the control

A register is named by a block and a tuple, and only the tuple is made of
elements: the control holds elements, so the tuple lives there, and the block –
finite, and one of finitely many – lives in the **phase**, which is where finite
data belongs. That is why `NexPh.buildP` and `NexPh.guessP` carry a `B`.

A destination phase is a *constant*, not a function of the control, so a sweep
whose pointer rolls over into the next block cannot decide that in the stepping
rule: the roll-over is its own rule, guarded by the pointer holding the last
tuple of its block (`SweepSpec.Roll`). The last register of the file is written
by a third – `Roll ∧ Done` – which moves right like the others and lands in
`NexPh.buildDoneP`, one cell past the file, where a fourth turns the machine
round. The last register has to be *written*, and the writes happen on the
right-moving steps, which is why the turn-around is a phase of its own and not
the exit guard of the sweep. The three guards at `NexPh.buildP` are pairwise
disjoint by construction, which is what `nexSep` reads off.

The exit into the next sweep **resets the pointer** (`SweepSpec.st0`): the sweep
that just finished left it at the file's last register, and the next one starts
at the first.
