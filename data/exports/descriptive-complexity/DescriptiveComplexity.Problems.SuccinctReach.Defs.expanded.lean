# SUCCINCT-REACH: reachability in a propositionally described transition system

The vocabulary and semantics of the canonical PSPACE problem of this library:
reachability in a graph whose vertices are the truth assignments to a set of
*state variables* and whose edges, source set and target set are described by
three CNF formulas rather than listed. The graph has exponentially many
vertices in the size of the instance – it is *succinctly represented* – which
is exactly why walking it costs polynomial space and not polynomial time.

Under other names the same problem is propositional STRIPS **plan existence**,
and it is the reachability query at the heart of symbolic model checking.

## The instance

An instance is a `FirstOrder.Language.transSys`-structure. Its elements are
propositional variables and clauses at once, as in
`FirstOrder.Language.sat`, with

* `stateVar x`: `x` is a state variable – a bit of the vertex being walked;
* `next x y`: `y` is the *next-state copy* of the state variable `x`, so that
  one clause set can talk about a state and its successor at once;
* `stepCl c`, `srcCl c`, `tgtCl c`: `c` is a clause of the transition, of the
  source or of the target formula;
* `posIn c x`, `negIn c x`: the variable `x` occurs positively (negatively) in
  the clause `c`, as for SAT.

Variables that are neither state variables nor next-state copies are
*auxiliary*: they are quantified existentially inside each clause group, which
is what lets a CNF describe an arbitrary transition relation (a Tseitin
encoding introduces exactly such variables for its gates).

## The semantics

A *state* is an arbitrary predicate on the universe; only its restriction to
the state variables matters, since that is all the clause groups can read
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ReadsCur`). There is a transition from `S` to `S'` when
some assignment satisfies every transition clause while reading `S` on the
state variables and writing `S'` on their next-state copies
(`DescriptiveComplexity.StepRel`). The instance is a yes-instance when some target
state is reachable from some source state
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SuccinctReachable`).

This is the *syntactic image* of SO(TC), in the same sense that a CNF is the
syntactic image of an existential second-order block: a state is a monadic
relation variable, a transition is a first-order condition on two consecutive
states, and reachability is the transitive closure. That is what makes the
membership half cheap (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.SuccinctReach.Membership`) and
the hardness half a Tseitin translation.
