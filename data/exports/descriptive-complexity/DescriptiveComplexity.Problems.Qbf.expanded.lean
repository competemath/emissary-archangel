# QBF: quantified Boolean formulas with bounded alternation

Umbrella file for the problems `DescriptiveComplexity.QBF k` – quantified Boolean
formulas with `k` alternating blocks of propositional quantifiers – the
canonical complete problems for the levels of the polynomial hierarchy
([Stockmeyer 1976][stockmeyer1976polynomial]; [Wrathall
1976][wrathall1976complete]).

* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Qbf.Defs`: the vocabulary
  `FirstOrder.Language.qbf k` (that of SAT, plus `k` unary block marks), the
  alternating semantics `DescriptiveComplexity.altQuant`, the two shapes of matrix
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.CnfSat`, `DescriptiveComplexity.DnfSat`) and their propositional
  duality, and the bundled problems `DescriptiveComplexity.QBF` /
  `DescriptiveComplexity.QBFPi`.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Qbf.Membership`: the membership half,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.qbfProblem_sigmaSODefinable` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.qbfProblem_piSODefinable`.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Qbf.Transfer`: the block-by-block transfer between
  alternation over truth assignments and alternation over second-order block
  assignments.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Qbf.Hardness`: the Tseitin interpretation with block
  marks, and its correctness at a fixed truth assignment.

## The parity of `k`

The matrix of `DescriptiveComplexity.QBF k` is conjunctive for odd `k` and disjunctive
for even `k`. This is forced, and is the standard form of the `Σₖᵖ`-complete
quantified Boolean formula problems. The hardness proof encodes the
first-order kernel of a second-order definition by the Tseitin translation
([Tseitin 1968][tseitin1968complexity]) of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Sat.Tseitin`, which introduces auxiliary *gate*
variables. Those are functionally determined by the block variables, so
`∃ gates, CNF(atoms, gates) ↔ φ(atoms)`, and the gate quantifier can be
absorbed into the innermost quantifier of the prefix **only when that
quantifier is existential** – otherwise the universal player falsifies a gate
clause and the instance collapses. For a prefix starting existentially the
innermost quantifier is existential exactly when `k` is odd; at even `k` one
uses the dual, disjunctive matrix, for which
`DescriptiveComplexity.dnfSat_iff_not_cnfSatWith_true` turns the innermost universal
quantifier back into an existential one over the gates.

Both halves are complete, for both families: `DescriptiveComplexity.QBF_complete` states
that `QBF (k + 1)` is `Σₖ₊₁ᵖ`-complete and `DescriptiveComplexity.QBFPi_complete` that
`QBFPi (k + 1)` is `Πₖ₊₁ᵖ`-complete, for every `k`. The two use the *same*
reduction, `DescriptiveComplexity.qbfReduction`, which is parameterized by the starting
polarity; only the parity of the matrix flips with it. At `k = 0` they
specialize to NP- and coNP-completeness
(`DescriptiveComplexity.QBF_one_NP_complete`, `DescriptiveComplexity.QBFPi_one_coNP_complete`).
Like the rest of the library the development is axiom-free: `#print axioms`
reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.
