# Max Cut is NP-complete

Umbrella file for `DescriptiveComplexity.MaxCut`, Karp's MAX CUT
([Karp 1972][karp1972reducibility]) on the arc-marked vocabulary reused from
Feedback Arc Set, deriving NP-completeness from

* `DescriptiveComplexity.maxCut_sigmaSODefinable`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.MaxCut.Membership`): membership, by guessing one
  side of the cut and an injection of the marked pairs into the cut;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.MaxCutRed.nae3Sat_ordered_fo_reduction_maxCut`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.MaxCut.Reduction`): hardness, from the NP-hardness
  of NAE-3SAT (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.NaeThreeSat`), and so ultimately from
  the Cook–Levin theorem, with no machine model anywhere.

No edge weights and no parallel edges are needed: the gadget graph is a plain
finite graph, its cut splits into three independently maximal families, and
the threshold is the `Set.ncard` of a marked binary relation. As with any
complexity-theoretic statement, these results are about finite structures only
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass.mem_congr_finite`/`hard_congr_finite`).
