# The halting problem reduces to Post's correspondence problem

**`DescriptiveComplexity.halt_ordered_fo_reduction_pcp`**: the classical
computation-history dominoes, as an ordered first-order reduction
`HALT ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] PCP`. The machine of the instance is *data*, so the reduction
writes one rule domino per combination of transition attributes, the copy and
bookkeeping dominoes beside them, and the initial configuration – the input
page between two endmarkers, with a boot letter in the state slot – as the one
long word of the start domino.

The construction is layered below this file:

* `Problems/Pcp/Hardness/History.lean` – dominoes decide derivability, for any
  string-rewriting system with nonempty rule sides;
* `Problems/Pcp/Hardness/ConfigWord.lean` – the rewriting system of a machine
  on the unbounded tape: derivability of the halting word is acceptance;
* `Problems/Pcp/Hardness/Draw.lean` – the elements and word tables of the
  drawn PCP instance;
* `Problems/Pcp/Hardness/Match.lean` – an instance reading as the drawing has
  a match exactly when the machine accepts;
* `Problems/Pcp/Hardness/Interp.lean` – the defining formulas realize the
  drawing.

With `DescriptiveComplexity.pcp_mem_RE` this makes PCP RE-complete as soon as
`HALT` is RE-hard, which is `DescriptiveComplexity.halt_RE_hard`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.HaltHard`).
