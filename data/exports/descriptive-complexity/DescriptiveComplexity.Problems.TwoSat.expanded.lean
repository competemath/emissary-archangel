# 2SAT is NL-complete

The width-two restriction of SAT (`DescriptiveComplexity.TwoSAT`) is complete for
`DescriptiveComplexity.NL`, the class defined by the Krom fragment of existential
second-order logic (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOKromDefinable`). This is the NL-level
analogue of HORN-SAT for PTIME and of SAT for NP, and like them it is
machine-free: both halves are first-order constructions over the fragment that
*defines* the class.

* Membership (`DescriptiveComplexity.twoSat_mem_NL`,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.TwoSat.Membership`): a Krom program that guesses the
  truth assignment and reads each input clause through a covering pair of
  occurrences. The width promise of 2SAT and the absence of an empty clause are
  enforced by *guards*, which are first-order over the input vocabulary – a
  promise costs one goal clause and no second-order machinery.
* Hardness (`DescriptiveComplexity.twoSat_hard_of_sigmaSOKromDefinable`,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.TwoSat.Hardness`): the Krom discharge, emitting one
  propositional 2-clause per clause of the program and per instantiation of its
  universally quantified variables satisfying its guard. The output is
  width-two by construction, exactly as the Horn discharge's output is Horn.

One thing is deliberately *not* claimed, as for HORN-SAT: **Grädel's capture
theorem against machines is not formalized.** That SO-Krom captures
nondeterministic logarithmic space on ordered structures ([Grädel
1992][gradel1992capturing]) has a direction that simulates a machine, and lies
outside a machine-model-free library; note also that its *easy* direction, `2SAT
∈ NL`, already needs Immerman–Szelepcsényi, since 2-satisfiability is the
complement of a reachability condition on the implication graph. So
`DescriptiveComplexity.NL` is *defined* as SO-Krom definability, exactly as
`DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME` is defined as SO-Horn definability.

Completeness is also what places NL inside the classes above it. Neither
inclusion is syntactic – a Krom kernel is not a Horn kernel – so both go through
this problem: 2SAT is in PTIME by the Horn program of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.TwoSat.Ptime`, which guesses reachability in the
implication graph, whence `DescriptiveComplexity.NL_subset_PTIME` and, composing with
`DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME_subset_NP`, `DescriptiveComplexity.NL_subset_NP`. The
logarithmic-space class below inherits both
(`DescriptiveComplexity.LOGSPACE_subset_PTIME`, `DescriptiveComplexity.LOGSPACE_subset_NP`),
its own inclusion in NL being immediate.
