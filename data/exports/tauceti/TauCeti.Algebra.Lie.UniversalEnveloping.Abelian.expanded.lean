# The enveloping algebra of an abelian Lie algebra is its symmetric algebra

Let `L` be an abelian Lie algebra over a commutative ring `R`, that is, one whose bracket vanishes
identically (`IsLieAbelian L`). This file proves that the canonical map
`ι : L → UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra R L` exhibits `U(L)` as the **symmetric algebra** of the
`R`-module `L`, and reads off the resulting basis of `U(L)`.

## What this says

The defining relation of `U(L)` is `ι x * ι y - ι y * ι x = ι ⁅x, y⁆`, so for an abelian `L` it is
the commutativity relation and nothing else: `U(L)` is commutative
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instCommRing`), and it is the *universal* commutative
`R`-algebra containing `L`, which is the symmetric algebra. Both algebras are therefore built by
the same universal property, and the comparison is the pair of lifts in either direction; nothing
finer, and in particular no Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt input, is used.

The consequence that is not visible in the universal property is the **basis**. The symmetric
algebra of a free module is a polynomial algebra (Mathlib's
`SymmetricAlgebra.equivMvPolynomial`), so for a basis `b` of `L` the algebra `U(L)` is the
polynomial algebra on the `b i` (`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.mvPolynomialEquiv`) and the
monomials `∏ᵢ ι(b i) ^ nᵢ` are an `R`-basis of it
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.basisMonomials`). That is the Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt
ordered-monomial theorem for an abelian Lie algebra: the ordering of a monomial carries no
information here, since the generators commute, so a monomial is recorded by its exponent
function `n : κ →₀ ℕ` rather than by a sorted word.

Two ring-theoretic finiteness properties transfer across the comparison with no further Lie theory:
`U(L)` is a **domain** over a domain when `L` is free as a module
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instIsDomain`), being a polynomial algebra, and it is
**Noetherian** over a Noetherian ring when `L` is finite as a module
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instIsNoetherianRing`), being then a commutative `R`-algebra of
finite type. Finite type needs no abelianness and so is not proved here: it is
`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instFiniteType` of
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/UniversalEnveloping/Basic.lean`, which only needs the canonical Lie generators
to generate `U(L)`. The two instances below are the abelian cases of two general
Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt corollaries, which over a field hold for every Lie algebra and every
finite-dimensional one respectively; the general statements go through the associated graded of the
PBW filtration and are not proved here, the arguments below using commutativity of `U(L)`
throughout.

The comparison also makes `ι` injective on any abelian `L`
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.ι_injective`), with no hypothesis on `L` as a module: it
identifies `ι` with the canonical map `L → S(L)`, which the square-zero extension `R ⊕ L` retracts.
For a general Lie algebra injectivity is instead a corollary of Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt, which
over a commutative ring needs `L` to be free (or at least projective) as an `R`-module, and is
unconditional only over a field.

## Where it is used

A Cartan subalgebra `H` of a Lie algebra `L` with non-degenerate Killing form is abelian, by
Mathlib's `LieAlgebra.IsKilling.instIsLieAbelianOfIsCartanSubalgebra`; that instance also asks that
`L` be free and finite as an `R`-module, that `R` be an integral domain and a principal ideal ring,
and that `L` be Artinian, all of which hold for a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field.
`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.symmetricAlgebraEquiv` then applies to `H` with no hypotheses
of its own beyond that abelianness, and identifies `U(H)` with `S(H)`. This identification is what
the Harish-Chandra projection of Layer 7 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md` is stated against, and the abelian
case of the ordered-monomial basis of the Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt sub-project of Layer 3, whose
spanning half is
`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.span_orderedPBWMonomials_eq_pbwFiltration`. The general theorem
is not proved here: the argument below uses commutativity of `U(L)` throughout and says nothing
about a non-abelian `L`.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instCommRing`: the enveloping algebra of an abelian Lie
  algebra is commutative.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.isSymmetricAlgebra_ι` and
  `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.symmetricAlgebraEquiv`: **`ι : L → U(L)` exhibits `U(L)` as
  the symmetric algebra of `L`**, with the resulting algebra isomorphism `S(L) ≃ₐ[R] U(L)`.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.mvPolynomialEquiv`: for a basis of `L`, the identification of
  `U(L)` with a polynomial algebra.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.ι_injective`: `ι` is injective, with no hypothesis on `L` as
  an `R`-module.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.basisMonomials`: the monomial basis of `U(L)`, with
  `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.linearIndependent_ι_basis`.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instIsDomain`: **`U(L)` is a domain** for an abelian `L` free
  as a module over a domain.
* `TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instIsNoetherianRing`: **`U(L)` is Noetherian** for an abelian
  `L` finite as a module over a Noetherian ring.
