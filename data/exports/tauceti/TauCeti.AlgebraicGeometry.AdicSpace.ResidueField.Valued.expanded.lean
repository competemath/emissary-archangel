# The residue field of a point as a topological field

`residueFieldValuation v` topologises the residue field `κ(v)` of a point `v : Spv A`, through
Mathlib's type synonym `WithVal`. This file describes the canonical map `A → κ(v)` for that
topology: the valuation it computes, and its continuity when `v` is a continuous point.

The algebraic content of `κ(v)` — the residue ring, the three valuations and their characteristic
equations — is in `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AdicSpace.ResidueField.Basic`, which carries no
topology. This file is where the topology enters, so that a consumer of `κ(v)` as a field need not
depend on the continuous-valuation API.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.valued_algebraMap_residueFieldValuation`: the valuation topologising
  `κ(v)` takes the image of `a : A` to `v.valuation a`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.continuous_algebraMap_residueFieldValuation`: for a continuous point
  of a ring with separately continuous operations, `A → κ(v)` is continuous.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic] (arXiv:1910.05934v1), §2.4 for the residue field and
  Definition 7.7 for continuity of a valuation.

/-- **A continuous point maps continuously to its residue field.** If `v : Spv A` is continuous
then the canonical map `A → WithVal (residueFieldValuation v)` is continuous, `κ(v)` carrying
the topology of `residueFieldValuation v`.

Separate continuity of the ring operations is enough: the topology and the ring structure of `A`
are related only through translations and multiplication by a constant. Continuity is what lets
the map be extended along a completion of `A`. -/
