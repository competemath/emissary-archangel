# Basic properties of the quantities in the finite-range claim

Elementary facts about `Sendov.M`, `Sendov.A`, `Sendov.c` and `Sendov.Q`, used by every
degree-specific argument.  The two facts that matter are:

* `Sendov.Q_nonneg`: the feasibility constraint `c ^ 2 ≤ A` says exactly that `Q` is a sum
  of squares, hence nonnegative.  This is what makes the real power `Q ^ ((n-4)/2)`
  appearing in `Sendov.R` behave, and in particular avoids the junk values of `Real.rpow`
  at negative bases.
* `Sendov.Q_one`: `Q n α 1 = α / (3 + α)`, the value `B` prescribed by the simplified polar
  inequality of the blog post.  Since `Q n α 1 = 1 - 2 * c n α + A n α`, this pins down
  `A - 2 * c = B - 1 < 0`, which is what gives `Sendov.Q_le_one`.

/-- Feasibility bounds `α` by `(n-1)/2`, simply because it forces `A = 1 - 2α/(n-1) ≥ 0`.

This crude consequence is all that the *numerical* step of any degree needs: on
`0 ≤ α ≤ min 17 ((n-1)/2)` the upper bounds for `R n α` used in this development stay below
`0.856` for every `5 ≤ n ≤ 97`.  The exact shape of the feasible region, which is cut out
by a quartic in `α`, is therefore never required by the polynomial certificates.

This must not be read as saying that `A ≥ 0` replaces feasibility everywhere.  It does not:
the odd-degree bound needs `0 ≤ Q n α t` on `[0,1]`, which is `Sendov.Q_nonneg` and uses the
full constraint `c ^ 2 ≤ A` — it does not follow from `A ≥ 0`.  Accordingly
`Sendov.integral_rpow_le` takes `hfeas` itself, and only the passage from the resulting
rational function to a polynomial positivity statement is weakened to `α ≤ M n / 2`.  For
even degrees the moment identity `Sendov.integral_moment` needs no hypothesis at all. -/

Only `0 ≤ c` is needed, not `0 ≤ A`: writing `Q t - 1 = t (A t - 2c)`, the identity
`Q 1 = B < 1` gives `A ≤ 2c` outright, and then `A t ≤ 2c` holds whether `A` is nonnegative
(as `A t ≤ A`) or negative (as `A t ≤ 0 ≤ 2c`).  That matters for batches of degrees whose
`α`-range reaches past `(n₀-1)/2`, where `A n₀ α` can be negative. -/
