# Definitions for the finite-range numerical claim

This file fixes the notation of the numerical claim `stat`, the one step of the proof that is
discharged by computation rather than by argument.  It contains definitions only; no statement
is made here.

`stat` cannot be stated in this file, because every other file in the development imports it
for the definitions below, and putting the claim at the bottom of the import graph would
prevent it from being proved.  It is stated and proved in `Sendov.FiniteRange.Cover`, so
auditing it means reading this file for the definitions and that one for the claim built from
them.

For where `stat` enters the proof as a whole, see `Sendov.Reduction.Main` and the repository
README; for the finite-range component on its own, see `docs/finite-range.md`.

## Background

In the blog post one argues by contradiction from a degree `n` polynomial with all zeroes
in the unit disk, a zero `0 ≤ a < 1`, and all critical points at distance `≥ 1` from `a`.
Writing `α := (n-1)(1-a²)/2` and `β(1) := 1 - 2ax + a²` (where `x` is the real part of the
mean of the reciprocal critical-point data), the post derives:

* `0 < β(1) < α/(3+α)` (the simplified polar inequality);
* `α ≤ 17` and an inequality `(1le)`, valid for `n ≥ 5`;
* the elimination of every degree `n ≥ 98` by an asymptotic argument.

Monotonicity in `β(1)` lets one replace `β(1)` by `α/(3+α)` in `(1le)`, which replaces
`a x` by `c` and `β(t)` by `Q t` below.  The resulting inequality is equation `stat` of the
post, namely `1 ≤ R n α`.  The upper bound `c ≤ a x` moreover forces the feasibility
constraint `c ^ 2 ≤ A`, which is what keeps `α` away from its formal upper limit `(n-1)/2`.

What is left open is that `stat` is infeasible on the remaining range

`5 ≤ n ≤ 97`,  `0 ≤ α ≤ 17`,  `c ^ 2 ≤ A`,

which is exactly `Sendov.finite_range` below.

## Main statements

* `Sendov.M`, `Sendov.A`, `Sendov.c`, `Sendov.Q`, `Sendov.R`: the quantities of `stat`.

The claim assembled from them lives in `Sendov.FiniteRange.Cover`:

* `Sendov.finite_range`: on the range above, `R n α < 1`;
* `Sendov.finite_range_le_100`: the same for `5 ≤ n ≤ 100`, which is what is actually
  proved — the finite certification was pushed past `97` to meet the large-degree argument;
* `Sendov.finite_range_contradiction`: consequently the post's equation `stat`,
  `1 ≤ R n α`, is contradictory on that range.  This is the form in which the claim is
  applied.

## Implementation notes

* `α = 0` is allowed, although the blog post has `α > 0` (an earlier inequality there was
  divided by `α`).  This makes the statement slightly stronger and is harmless: the bound
  extends continuously to `α = 0` and stays below `1` there.
* No upper bound on `α` in terms of `n` is assumed: `hfeas` already forces `0 ≤ A n α`,
  hence `α ≤ (n-1)/2`.
* The exponent `((n:ℝ) - 4) / 2` is a half-integer for odd `n`, so `Q n α t ^ _` is
  `Real.rpow`.  Under `hfeas` one has `0 ≤ Q n α t` for `0 ≤ t ≤ 1`, so no junk values of
  `rpow` at negative bases arise; the integrand is continuous, so no integrability
  hypothesis is needed either.

## Numerical diagnostics

These are *not* inputs to the proof, and must not be used as hypotheses; they are recorded
only to indicate the size of the margin.  Numerically, `R n α` attains a maximum of about
`0.8529` over the feasible range, at `n = 53`, `α = 17` — which remains inside the range
below, so shortening it does not make the claim easier.  For comparison, `R 5 0 ≈ 0.6458`
and `R 97 17 ≈ 0.2921`.  The feasibility constraint is binding at low degree: it caps
`α ≲ 1.68` when `n = 5` and `α ≲ 2.19` when `n = 6`, and only ceases to cut into
`[0, 17]` from `n = 36` onwards.
