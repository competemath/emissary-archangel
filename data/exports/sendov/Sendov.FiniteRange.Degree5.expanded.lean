# The finite-range claim in degree five

The lowest degree, where the exponent `(n-4)/2` is `0 + 1/2`, so `Sendov.R 5 α` involves
`√Q` itself.

The informal plan treats this degree separately, on the ground that bound `(O)` — the
tangent line at `q = 1` — is too wasteful here, and proposes instead the chord bound
`Q(t) ≤ 1 - (1-B)t`, the resulting formula for `∫ t³ √(1-(1-B)t) dt` in half-integer powers
of `B`, and the substitution `α = 3r²/(1-r²)` needed to make that rational.

None of this is necessary.  The waste in `(O)` comes entirely from the tangent line being
taken at `q = 1`, whereas the values of `Q` that matter here are small; taking the tangent
at `q = w²` for a smaller rational `w` fixes it.  With `w = 1/3`, `Sendov.integral_rpow_le`
gives `√Q ≤ 3Q/2 + 1/6` and hence

  `∫ t in 0..1, t³ √Q dt ≤ (3/2) (1/4 - 2c/5 + A/6) + 1/24`,

which is already enough.  So degree five uses exactly the same machinery as every other
odd degree, with only the parameter `w` changed, and no square roots survive.

With `M 5 = 4`, `A 5 α = 1 - α/2` and `c 5 α = (12 - α - α²)/(4(3+α))`, the resulting upper
bound for `R 5 α` is `1 - P α / (96 (3+α)²)` with

  `P α = -9α⁴ - 123α³ + 596α² + 30α + 234`,

which is positive up to `α = 3.912`, while feasibility gives `α ≤ 2` outright (this is the
one degree where `Sendov.alpha_le_half_M` is exactly the bound `A 5 α ≥ 0`).  For
orientation: over the feasible range `α ≤ 1.678` the exact maximum of `R 5 α` is about
`0.716`, against `0.737` for this upper bound — whereas `w = 1` would give `1.063`, above
`1`, and would prove nothing.
