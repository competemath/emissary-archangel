# The numerical claim, for every degree

This is the top of the development.  `Sendov.Defs` fixes the notation of equation `stat`
of the blog post; everything else establishes that its right-hand side `R n α` is below `1`.
Two arguments meet here.

* `Sendov.finite_range_le_100` certifies `5 ≤ n ≤ 100` by explicit polynomial arithmetic:
  the integral is a finite sum of moments, the moments come from a packed recurrence, and
  each of 31 batches of degrees carries one Bernstein certificate in `α`.
* `Sendov.large_degree` covers `n ≥ 101` analytically: the integral is bounded by a Beta
  integral plus a geometric tail, the resulting elementary bound `U` is shown decreasing in
  the degree, and its value at `n = 101` is below `1` by one more Bernstein certificate.

The two ranges overlap in intent but not in method, and the seam is at `100/101` rather than
at the `97/98` of the blog post: the finite side was pushed three degrees further so that the
analytic side would start with margin `0.122` instead of `0.048`.

## Main statements

* `Sendov.stat_lt_one`: `R n α < 1` for every `n ≥ 5`, `0 ≤ α ≤ 17` with `c ^ 2 ≤ A`;
* `Sendov.stat_contradiction`: equation `stat` of the blog post is therefore unsatisfiable.
