# The bound `α ≤ 17`

This is `(beta-bound) + (origin-exact) ⟹ (17)`, the last link of the chain.  Suppose `α > 17`.
Feasibility gives `n - 1 ≥ 2α > 34`, so `n ≥ 36`, and after discarding `ax > 0` and bounding
`1 - x² ≤ 1`, `(origin-exact)` reads

  `2α ≤ 1/(2(n-1)) + a² n (n-1) ∫₀¹ t β(t)^((n-2)/2) dt`.

The integral is split by `Sendov.integral_le_tail_lin` — the `k = 1` instance of the chord
bound — into a Beta value plus `β(1)^((n-2)/2)/2`.  Both halves of `(beta-bound)` are then
used, and this is the only place where the logarithmic half is needed:

* `x² ≥ 1 - β(1) ≥ log α / α` turns the Beta term into `4α/log α`;
* `β(1) ≤ e^{β(1)-1} ≤ α^{-1/α}` makes the second term decay geometrically.

Dividing by `α` leaves `2 ≤ 1/(2(n-1)α) + 4/log α + T`, and the substitution
`v := (n-1)/(2α) - 1` (the write-up's `u = a²/(1-a²)`) turns `T` into
`v(2(v+1) + 1/α) α^{-v} · α^{1/(2α)}`, which is bounded by an ordinary polynomial inequality
after four terms of the exponential series.  The three pieces come to `0.0009 + 1.4135 +
0.5054 = 1.920 < 2`.

The write-up uses `∫₀^∞ t e^{-ct} dt` here and reaches `1.948`; the Beta route used instead
reaches `1.817`, and the extra room is what pays for the crude constants below.

## Main statements

* `Sendov.log_seventeen_ge`, `Sendov.log_le_div_exp_one`: the two facts about `log` needed;
* `Sendov.alpha_le_seventeen`: `(beta-bound) + (origin-exact) ⟹ α ≤ 17`.
