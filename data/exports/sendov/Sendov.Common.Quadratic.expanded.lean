# The quadratic `1 - 2ct + At²`

Two quadratics drive the whole development, and they are the same object with different
parameters:

* `β(t) = 1 - 2axt + a²t²`, the quantity the blog post's inequalities are stated in;
* `Q n α t = 1 - 2c(α)t + a²t²`, what `β` becomes after `β(1)` is replaced by `α/(3+α)`.

So the facts about them — nonnegativity under feasibility, the chord bound below the vertex,
monotonicity above it — are proved once here for

  `QQ c A t = 1 - 2ct + At²`,

and `Sendov.Q n α t = QQ (c n α) (A n α) t` holds by `rfl`.

Note which hypothesis each fact needs.  Nonnegativity is exactly feasibility `c² ≤ A`, since
`QQ = (1-ct)² + (A-c²)t²`.  The bound `QQ ≤ 1` on `[0,1]` needs only `0 ≤ c` together with
`QQ 1 ≤ 1`: writing `QQ t - 1 = t(At - 2c)`, the value at `t = 1` already gives `A ≤ 2c`, and
then `At ≤ 2c` whether `A` is nonnegative (as `At ≤ A`) or negative (as `At ≤ 0 ≤ 2c`).  That
matters, because `A` is genuinely negative in parts of the range.

## Main statements

* `Sendov.QQ_nonneg`, `Sendov.QQ_le_one`;
* `Sendov.QQ_le_chord`: `QQ t ≤ 1 - ct` below the vertex;
* `Sendov.QQ_le_at_one`: `QQ t ≤ QQ 1` above it.
