# Unitarity of the tensor-factor swap matrix

This file packages the self-adjoint involution property of QICLean's tensor-factor
swap matrix as unitarity between its product-coordinate spaces.

## Main result

* `Matrix.swapMatrix_isUnitaryBetween`: the tensor-factor swap matrix is unitary between
  its source and target product-coordinate orders.

/-- The tensor-factor swap matrix is unitary between its product-coordinate spaces.

With columns as source coordinates and rows as target coordinates, `swapMatrix d` sends the
source coordinate `(i, j)` to the target coordinate `(j, i)`. This is the exchange matrix
used in the shift-MPU source factors of arXiv:1703.09188, equations `eq:SF_u1_u3`,
`eq:uv2_U2`, and `eq:uv2_U3` (lines 2009--2034), and as the endpoint of the
unitary interpolation at lines 2148--2150. -/
