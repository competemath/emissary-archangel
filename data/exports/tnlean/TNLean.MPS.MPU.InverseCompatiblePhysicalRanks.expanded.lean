# Physical dimensions of the inverse-compatible source ranks

For a simple canonical-form-II MPU whose physical adjoint is related to the
same tensor by a unitary virtual gauge, the existing cut comparison gives
$r=\ell$. The simple-MPU rank product $r\ell=d^2$ then yields $\ell=d$ and
$r=d$. A single equivalence identifies the common raw source rank with the
physical index; no independent endpoint casts are chosen.

Source: CPSV17, `ThmFund1` (arXiv:1703.09188, lines 563–571), and FBC25,
`eq:defT` in the self-inverse case (arXiv:2502.20257, lines 1552–1563), with
the cut comparison at lines 5432–5443. This is a consequence of the stated
self-adjoint gauge hypothesis, not the general finite-group index argument
at line 1547. No scalar relation, adjoint simplicity, additional positivity,
or new virtual gauge is required. Only ranks and their coordinates are
identified here, not physical composition or the complementary relation.
