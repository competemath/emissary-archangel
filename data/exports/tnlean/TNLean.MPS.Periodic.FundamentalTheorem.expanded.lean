# Components of the periodic Fundamental Theorem of MPS

This file develops conditional block-matching results toward the periodic
Fundamental Theorem of arXiv:1708.00029, Section 3, and the Z-gauge theory used
in its equal-case strengthening:

* **Conditional block matching** (`fundamentalTheorem_periodic_proportional`):
  if two non-repeated block families satisfy a supplied periodic-overlap
  hypothesis, their blocks match bijectively up to `RepeatedBlocks`. Source
  theorem `thm:bd` instead assumes proportionality of the assembled MPV
  families. The companion module `ProportionalOverlap` proves the deduction
  for literal multiplicity-bearing families of spectrally periodic blocks,
  including transport through their sectorwise Perron similarities, and
  assembles the source-labelled theorem
  `fundamentalTheorem_periodic_proportional_sectorDecomposition` over the
  stronger witness `PeriodicBasisMatchingWitness`, which retains equality of
  the matched periods.

* **Supporting lemmas for the equal-case theorem `thm:bdequal`**: The equal-case
  strengthening produces per-block Z-gauge data (diagonal Z with Z^m = 1) from the
  Newton–Girard identity on multiplicity entries.
  The Z-gauge construction is packaged in `zgauge_construction`.

## Conditional block matching from periodic overlaps

The block-matching conclusion used toward theorem `thm:bd` has two conditional
forms:

* `fundamentalTheorem_periodic_proportional` takes a `PeriodicOverlapHypothesis` directly,
  leaving callers free to supply the dichotomy from any source.
* `fundamentalTheorem_periodic_proportional_of_isPeriodic` is a variant that no
  longer takes `PeriodicOverlapHypothesis` as a parameter: the
  `hetRepeatedBlocks_of_nondecaying` field is filled inside
  `PeriodicOverlapHypothesis.ofIsPeriodic` via `periodicOverlapDichotomy`.
  Callers only need to supply per-block `IsPeriodic` data
  plus the existence of non-decaying cross-family overlaps
  (`exists_nondecaying_A/B`). The companion module `ProportionalOverlap`
  derives these witnesses from nonzero proportionality for literal
  multiplicity-bearing families of normalized periodic blocks, and also for
  the more restrictive scalar-weight irreducible-form representation.

  The overlap dichotomy, including the full-cycle contraction with \(F_u\),
  \(\Omega_u\), and the phases \(\kappa_v\), is proved in
  `TNLean.MPS.Periodic.Overlap.SectorMatch` and assembled in
  `TNLean.MPS.Periodic.Overlap.Dichotomy`.

The Z-gauge construction (the scalar-entry part of `thm:bdequal`) is fully proved.

/-- **Conditional block matching from a periodic-overlap hypothesis.**

If two non-repeated block families satisfy the periodic overlap dichotomy, then
their bases of periodic tensors match: equal block counts, a bijection, and per-block
`HetRepeatedBlocks` equivalence.

**Scope restriction (conditional overlap hypothesis):** source theorem
`thm:bd` at arXiv:1708.00029, lines 613--623 assumes proportional assembled
MPVs. Here the required non-decaying partners and their repeated-block
classification are supplied directly through `PeriodicOverlapHypothesis`.
Thus this theorem is a conditional matching lemma toward `thm:bd`, not its
formalization. The gap is recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/dccsp17_periodic_overlap_route_alignment.tex`.

The proof follows the same finite-matching pattern as the current
sector-decomposition matching theorem:
1. Non-decaying overlap → `HetRepeatedBlocks` matching for each block.
2. Injectivity from `HetRepeatedBlocks.trans` + non-repetition.
3. Injective maps on finite types → equal cardinalities.
4. Bijection construction.

The single-block equal-MPV theorem
`peripheralProportionalCase_periodicFT_of_sameMPV₂Pos` yields the repeated-block
conclusion for different bond dimensions. The companion module
`ProportionalOverlap` supplies the multi-block non-decaying cross-overlap
hypotheses for literal multiplicity-bearing normalized periodic forms, with
`PeriodicOverlapHypothesis.ofIsIrreducibleForm` as a scalar-weight
specialization. Its theorem
`PeriodicOverlapHypothesis.ofSpectrallyPeriodicSectorDecompositions` performs
the sectorwise Perron normalization and transports the hypothesis back to the
original spectral-radius-one blocks. Combining the two gives the source-labelled
`fundamentalTheorem_periodic_proportional_sectorDecomposition`, which also

This variant of `fundamentalTheorem_periodic_proportional` no longer takes
`PeriodicOverlapHypothesis` as a parameter; instead, the dichotomy field is filled via
`periodicOverlapDichotomy`. The caller only needs to supply `IsPeriodic` data plus the
existence of non-decaying cross-family overlaps.

The overlap-dichotomy input is unconditional: its sector-match branch uses the proved
full-cycle contraction `sectorTensor_proportional_of_blockedMatch`. The explicit
non-decaying cross-family overlap hypotheses remain additional inputs.

Given two multiplicity-entry families where:

2. The denominator entries are nonzero,
3. Power sums agree for all positive exponents,

produces: multiplicity-entry multiset equality, a diagonal Z with `Z^m = 1`, and

independence + equal MPVs (via `power_sums_eq_of_eventually_eq_hetero`), and

/-- **Scalar component of the equal-case periodic FT (arXiv:1708.00029).**

If two MPS tensors in irreducible form with non-repeated blocks satisfy the periodic
overlap dichotomy and per-block multiplicity-entry power equality, then:

1. **Block matching**: equal block counts, a bijection, and per-block `HetRepeatedBlocks`.
2. **Scalar multiplicity-entry Z-gauge**: for each matched pair with period `m_j`,
   there exists a `1 × 1` diagonal matrix `Z_j` with `Z_j^{m_j} = 1` and
   `Z_j * diag(μA_j) = diag(μB_{perm j})`.
3. **Multiplicity-entry equality**: `μA_j` and `μB_{perm j}` determine the same
   singleton multiset.

This composes the conditional block-matching lemma with the scalar Z-gauge
construction.

**Scope restriction (conditional scalar component):** the declaration assumes
both `PeriodicOverlapHypothesis` and the power equality `hPowEq`, and it treats
only one-dimensional multiplicity spaces. Source theorem `thm:bdequal` at
arXiv:1708.00029, lines 643--690 derives the corresponding facts from equal
MPVs and allows arbitrary diagonal multiplicity matrices `R_j, S_j`. Hence the
