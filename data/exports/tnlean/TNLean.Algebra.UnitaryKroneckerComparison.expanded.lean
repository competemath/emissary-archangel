# Comparison of matrix factorizations with unitary Kronecker gauges

This file isolates the matrix-algebraic core of the uniqueness argument for
three-legged decompositions of a matrix product unitary.  A chosen left inverse
and right inverse identify the comparison matrix between two factorizations.
When two such comparison matrices have unitary Kronecker product, their
reciprocal positive rescalings give the unitary gauges in the orientation of
the original decompositions.

## Main results

- `Matrix.factorization_comparison_of_one_sided_inverses`: compares two equal
  rectangular matrix factorizations using chosen one-sided inverses.
- `Matrix.exists_reciprocal_unitary_gauges_of_comparison`: converts two
  comparison matrices with unitary Kronecker product into reciprocal unitary
  gauges.

of `Xt`, and `R` is a right inverse of `Y`.  Then `Lt * X` is the comparison
matrix between the two factorizations.

/-- Two comparison matrices whose Kronecker product `K₁ ⊗ₖ K₂` is unitary
determine unitary gauges with reciprocal positive scalars.  If the returned
scalar is `δ`, the source-oriented scalars are `δ⁻¹` for the first factor and
`δ` for the second, so their product is one.

The unitary matrices in the conclusion are the inverses, equivalently the
adjoints, of the unitary factors of the comparison matrices.  This is the
reciprocal-unitary-gauge step in FBC25, Lemma `lem:deco`
