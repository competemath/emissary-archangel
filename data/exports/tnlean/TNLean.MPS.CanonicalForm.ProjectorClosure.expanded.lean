# Invariant-projector closure

This file isolates the normalization-free algebraic step in the sufficient
condition for canonical form from Cirac, Pérez-García, Schuch, and Verstraete,
arXiv:1606.00608, lines 253--254.

The source assumes that every orthogonal projection satisfying
\(P A^i = P A^i P\) also satisfies \(A^i P = P A^i P\).  The recursive
decomposition in `MPSTensor.exists_irreducible_blockDecomp` uses the opposite
orientation, \((1-P)A^iP=0\).  Applying the source hypothesis to \(1-P\)
shows that such a projection commutes with every tensor matrix.  This argument
does not require a left-canonical or unital normalization.

The subsequent passage from these reducing projections to primitive,
spectral-radius-one blocks is not proved here.  Its missing spectral statement
is recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/cpsv16_projector_closure_canonical_form.tex`.
