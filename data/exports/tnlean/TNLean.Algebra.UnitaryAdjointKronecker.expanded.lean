# Unitarity from an adjoint Kronecker product

For a complex matrix between two nonempty finite coordinate spaces, unitarity
of $K^\dagger \otimes K$ implies unitarity of $K$. No equality of the two
coordinate-space cardinalities is assumed.

This is the general matrix implication used in arXiv:2502.20257,
lines 5444--5487, after the gate identity
$u=\sigma(K^\dagger\otimes K)v^\dagger$. The gate identity itself is not
asserted here.

/-- A complex matrix is unitary between its coordinate spaces if its adjoint
Kronecker product is unitary. The reciprocal scalar Gram matrices have scalar
square one; Gram positivity excludes the negative root.

Source use: arXiv:2502.20257, lines 5444--5487. This implication applies to
rectangular matrices without an equal-cardinality hypothesis. -/
