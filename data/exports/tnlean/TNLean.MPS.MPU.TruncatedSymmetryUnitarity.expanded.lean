# Unitarity of truncated symmetries at every bulk length

For a simple MPU in canonical form II, the endpoint contraction in
arXiv:2502.20257, `eq:truncsym` and the sentence immediately following it
(lines 2062–2101), is unitary between its input and output coordinate spaces.
Here `N` counts bulk sites, while the source total length is $L=N+2\geq2$
(`eq:truncsym`, lines 2094–2097; CZX display, lines 4700–4713). The corresponding
source length notation is $U_g^{N+2}$, not $U_g^N$. The zero-bulk base case has
total length two and is the source gate $u$ of arXiv:1703.09188,
`uu` (lines 532–543), whose unitarity follows from the simple-MPU
source-gate equivalence theorem of arXiv:1703.09188 (lines 563–601). Each
additional bulk site is added by the unitary left movement gate of
arXiv:2502.20257, `cor:mpu`(a), using the left-end factorization of
`eq:move_trunc_sym`.

**Scope restriction (endpoint-coordinate unitarity):** the conclusion is
unitary-between the stated rectangularly indexed coordinate spaces. The
two-sided source-factorization growth identity of `eq:move_trunc_sym` is
formalized separately in `TruncatedSymmetryGrowth`. This theorem does not
identify each endpoint source space with a physical site, specialize to a
finite-group operator, prove agreement of the interior action with a global
symmetry, or establish the complementary finite-chain relation following
`eq:move_trunc_sym`. Documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/fbc25_truncated_symmetry_endpoint_unitarity_scope.tex`.
No adjoint-simplicity premise is used.

/-- The truncated symmetry is unitary between its coordinate spaces for every
number `N` of bulk sites, hence every source total length $L=N+2\geq2$.
In source length notation this is $U_g^{N+2}$; the `N = 0` base case is the
two-site endpoint contraction, not a length-zero operator.
Source: arXiv:2502.20257, `eq:truncsym` and its
following unitarity assertion (lines 2062–2101). The assumptions are precisely
canonical form II and simplicity; the source and movement gate unitarities
are derived rather than supplied as hypotheses. -/
