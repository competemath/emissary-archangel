# The scalar parity law for the blocked time-reversal sign

Blocking a time-reversal-invariant matrix product unitary produces one sign for
each blocking level. The blocking argument of arXiv:1703.09188 identifies the
sign at level `k` as `σ⁽¹⁾ζ^{k-1}`, where `ζ = σ⁽¹⁾σ⁽²⁾` is the ratio of the
signs at the first two levels (`paper_v2.tex` line 1687), and where the closing
identity `σ⁽ᵏ⁾ = σ⁽¹⁾ζ^{k-1}` is stated at `paper_v2.tex` line 1732.

This file isolates the scalar consequence of that identity for signs valued in
`{1, -1}`: the sign at level `k` is the first sign for odd `k` and the second
sign for even `k`. Only the sign algebra is treated here; the tensor-network
unwinding that produces the identity is not.

## Main results

- `TNLean.Algebra.blockedSign_eq_first_of_odd`: for odd blocking length the sign
  is the first sign.
- `TNLean.Algebra.blockedSign_eq_second_of_even`: for even blocking length the
  sign is the second sign.
