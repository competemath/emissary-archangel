# Positive-weight normalization for the PGVWC07 witness

This module records the finite-family scalar normalization of the positive
weights in the positive-length PGVWC07 canonical-form witness.

Pérez-García, Verstraete, Wolf, and Cirac, Theorem Th:TIcanonical, proof
lines 765--766, says that the spectral radius may be normalized without loss
of generality.  The theorem below proves the finite positive-weight part of
that convention: divide all weights by their largest value, so that every
normalized weight has norm at most one and one has norm one.  The statement
also records the global scalar factor on every positive-length MPV
coefficient.

The canonical-form existence theorem is stated with positive-length equality
after a positive global rescaling of the original tensor.  This file also
records the complementary explicit statement for the branch in which the family
of nonzero blocks is empty, so that no positive-length nonzero MPV coefficient
remains to normalize.  The convention is recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/pgvwc07_ti_canonical_form_scope.tex`.

/-- Normalize the positive weights in a nonempty PGVWC07 positive-length
witness by their largest value.

Pérez-García, Verstraete, Wolf, and Cirac, Theorem Th:TIcanonical, proof
lines 765--766, says that the spectral radius may be normalized without loss
of generality.  This theorem records the corresponding scalar convention for
the positive-length witness: after dividing all weights by their maximum, every
new weight has norm at most one and one weight has norm one.  The conclusion
also records the global factor `scale ^ N` on length-`N` MPV coefficients. -/

/-- Exact positive-length PGVWC07 canonical-form witness, allowing the empty
nonzero-block family in the zero positive-length branch.

Pérez-García, Verstraete, Wolf, and Cirac, Theorem Th:TIcanonical, lines
742--763, is a theorem about finite rings of positive length.  The preceding
dichotomy separates the case in which all positive-length MPV coefficients
vanish.  This theorem records the corresponding positive-length convention for
that branch: the nonzero-block family is empty.  Thus the positive-weight,
unital, scalar-fixed-point, and dual-diagonal requirements are vacuous in the
zero branch, while the positive-length MPV equality is exact after the same
global rescaling convention used in the nonzero branch.

When the block family is nonempty, at least one normalized weight has norm
one.  This is the precise replacement for the unit-weight conclusion in the
zero branch, where no positive block exists. -/
