# Multiplicative coboundaries on recurrent directed graphs

An edge weight on a directed graph is a vertex coboundary when it is the ratio
of vertex weights at the endpoints of every edge. This file proves that trivial
weight around every closed directed walk is sufficient when every directed edge
admits a directed return walk.

The proof chooses one vertex in each reachability component and defines the
vertex weight by multiplication along a walk from that vertex. Trivial closed
walk weights make this choice independent of the walk.

## Implementation notes

The local `DirectedWalk` is a type-valued walk over an ordinary proposition-
valued relation. This connects directly to relations such as
`MPOTensor.IsSectorEdge` and allows a walk to be eliminated into its weight in
an arbitrary monoid. In contrast, `Relation.ReflTransGen` is proposition-valued
and therefore cannot in general be eliminated into such data, while
`Quiver.Path` would first require replacing the proposition-valued relation by
a quiver of edge types.

`TNLean.Algebra.FiniteCycleCoboundary` treats the complementary special case of
one finite cycle. Reachability by a directed walk is equivalent to the
reflexive transitive closure of the edge relation; this permits direct use with
relations defined through `Relation.ReflTransGen`.

A nonempty closed walk also determines a finite cyclic family of vertices.
Every consecutive pair is an edge, including the final return to the initial
vertex, and the cyclic product of the edge weights equals the walk weight.
