# Comparison of unitary factorizations

Given a family of unitary operators indexed by pairs, this file compares two
members by multiplying the first by the inverse of the second.  The orientation
is

`unitaryFactorizationComparison R a b c d = (R c d)⁻¹ * R a b`.

For unitary matrices, the inverse is the adjoint.  Thus this is precisely the
operator $\lambda_{a,b}^{c,d} = (\lambda^R_{c,d})^\dagger\lambda^R_{a,b}$ in
the corollary following FBC25, Proposition `prop:3`
(arXiv:2502.20257, lines 2782--2821).

The algebra does not use equalities between products of the indices.  Such
equalities only determine which factorizations are compared in applications.
