# Canonical form existence reductions from the source proofs

This file collects the arbitrary-tensor reductions toward the canonical-form construction for
MPS tensors from Cirac–Pérez-García–Schuch–Verstraete, arXiv:1606.00608.

The file contains the following reductions from arXiv:1606.00608 and the
translation-invariant canonical-form theorem of Pérez-García, Verstraete, Wolf,
and Cirac:

* arXiv:1606.00608, lines 201-219: iterated invariant-projection splitting gives an
  irreducible block decomposition.
* arXiv:1606.00608, lines 1058-1077: after canonical form has been obtained,
  the canonical-form-II gauge makes the associated maps trace-preserving and
  gives diagonal full-rank fixed points.
* Pérez-García, Verstraete, Wolf, and Cirac, proof of Theorem Th:TIcanonical,
  lines 765-770 and 827-832: the full-rank fixed-point gauge and the final
  dual fixed-point diagonalization.

We also keep a couple of formulations for already-normalized primitive / injective block families,
but those are **not** obtained from arbitrary input in this file.

Note: the Appendix-A CFII story is genuinely two-step:
first a generally non-unitary TP similarity from the adjoint Perron--Frobenius eigenvector,
then a unitary diagonalization **within** that TP gauge.

The reductions below are composed with finite-family weight normalization to
obtain the arbitrary-input positive-length PGVWC07 canonical form.  After a
positive global rescaling, the conclusion gives positive weights, unital blocks,
diagonal full-rank dual fixed points, scalar transfer-map fixed points, and the
bond-dimension bound.  If every positive-length MPV coefficient vanishes, the
nonzero-block family is empty.

The later Fundamental-Theorem reductions--TP gauge, period removal, common
blocking, and normal/BNT predicates--are subsequent consequences of the
canonical-form outputs, not missing conclusions of PGVWC07 Theorem
Th:TIcanonical.

Maintainer note: the blueprint cites
`MPSTensor.exists_pgvwc07_normalized_exact_form_after_rescaling_allow_empty` in
`TNLean.MPS.CanonicalForm.NormalReduction.WeightNormalization`.  The
positive-length bond-dimension bound is recorded by
`MPSTensor.exists_pgvwc07_unital_dualDiag_from_arbitrary` in
`TNLean.MPS.CanonicalForm.NormalReduction.TPGauge`.  The audit boundary is
recorded in `docs/paper-gaps/pgvwc07_ti_canonical_form_scope.tex`.
For Pérez-García, Verstraete, Wolf, and Cirac, the faithful proof order is the
one in `Papers/quant-ph_0608197/MPSarchive.tex`: lines 765–770 for
spectral-radius normalization and the full-rank fixed-point gauge, lines
771–815 for deriving the invariant support from a singular positive fixed point
and then splitting the trace, lines 816–826 for iteration and non-scalar
fixed-point splitting, and lines 827–832 for dual fixed-point diagonalization.

## External input — Quantum Wielandt strong irreducibility ⇒ full Kraus rank

This file imports `TNLean.Wielandt.Primitivity.StronglyIrreducibleToFullRank`,
which supplies the hardest direction of the Quantum Wielandt primitivity equivalence:

> **Proposition 3(c)→(b) of arXiv:0909.5347 / Wolf Theorem 6.7 case (iii).**
> If `E_A` is **strongly irreducible** — the Kraus operators' word products
> eventually span the full matrix algebra `M_D(ℂ)` — then the fixed-point
> space of `E_A` has full Kraus rank: `dim S_1(A) = D` (the Kraus operators
> themselves span `M_D(ℂ)` at word-length `1`).

In MPS notation after blocking: `IsStronglyIrreducible A` (Kraus word products
eventually span `M_D(ℂ)`) implies `IsInjective A` (the single-site
Kraus operators `{A_i}` already span `M_D(ℂ)`).  This is a
step in the canonical-form existence argument: it upgrades the cumulative word
span to single-site injectivity, which then yields block injectivity at every
positive length.

The formal statement:

> `Wielandt.Primitivity.StronglyIrreducibleToFullRank` proves the implication
> `IsStronglyIrreduciblePaper A → krausRank A = D` (equivalently,
> `Kraus.wordSpan A 1 = ⊤`).  This proves the hardest direction
> in the Sanz–Pérez-García–Wolf–Cirac primitivity equivalence.

## External input — invariant subspace decomposition in the canonical-form proof

The iterated invariant-projection splitting in arXiv:1606.00608, lines
201–219, is formalized in
`TNLean.MPS.Structure.InvariantSubspaceDecomp`.
This external input provides:

> **Pérez-García, Verstraete, Wolf, and Cirac, proof of Theorem
> Th:TIcanonical, lines 765–833.**
> An invariant orthogonal projection `P` on the bond space (satisfying
> `(1-P) A_i P = 0` for all `i`) yields an MPV-equivalent two-block direct-sum
> tensor with strictly smaller block dimensions.

The formal statement:

> `MPSTensor.exists_twoBlock_decomp_of_lowerZero` produces a two-block
> block-diagonal tensor MPV-equivalent to the original, with a strict dimension
> decrease (`exists_twoBlock_decomp_of_lowerZero_strict`).

## External input — Wolf spectral theory: Perron-Frobenius fixed point

The Appendix A PF/TP gauge step uses the Perron-Frobenius theorem for
completely positive maps (Wolf Chapter 6), formalized in
`QICLean.Channel.PerronFrobenius.Existence`:

> An irreducible CP map on `M_D(ℂ)` with spectral radius `1` has a
> positive-definite fixed point `ρ > 0`.  This provides the TP gauge
> transformation `A_i ↦ ρ^{1/2} A_i ρ^{-1/2}` that makes the
> tensor left-canonical.

The complementary transfer-map gap connection to peripheral primitivity is supplied by
`QICLean.Kraus.PrimitiveFixedPoint.FromPeripheral` (Wolf Proposition 6.8).

We collect `exists_unitary_diag_posDef_fixedPoint_of_TP_of_isIrreducibleTensor` together with the
fact that unitary conjugation preserves MPVs.

Important: this is the **second** half of the Appendix-A normalization story. The preceding
PF / TP-gauge step is generally a non-unitary similarity; the unitary appearing here acts only
after one has already moved into the one-sided TP gauge.

/-- **CFII fixed-point normalization for irreducible trace-preserving blocks.**

For an irreducible tensor `A` in the TP gauge (`∑ Aᵢ†Aᵢ = I`) and with `0 < D`, there exist

* a unitary `U`,
* a diagonal positive-definite matrix `Λ`,

such that the unitary conjugate tensor
`B i := U† * A i * U` is still TP, has `Λ` as a fixed point of its transfer map, and is
`SameMPV₂`-equivalent to `A` (unitary gauge equivalence).

This is the formal analogue of bringing a block into **Canonical Form II** (CFII) *after*
one has already chosen a TP representative; it does not say that the original pre-TP-gauge tensor
is related to a CFII representative by a unitary similarity alone. -/

## Irreducible decomposition from arbitrary input

The arbitrary-input part of this file stops at the nonzero irreducible block decomposition below.
The blockwise trace-preserving gauge is constructed in `NormalReduction/TPGauge.lean`; subsequent
period removal and normalization are developed in the normal-reduction modules.

The normal-canonical-form file starts from a primitive weighted block family with positive bond
dimensions and non-increasing nonzero weight moduli. This file does **not** construct that input
from an arbitrary tensor.

Subsequent stages toward a complete canonical-form existence theorem are:

* Apply the TP-irreducible-to-primitive blocking theorem and then perform the post-blocking cyclic
  sector bookkeeping and weight normalization needed for non-increasing nonzero weight moduli.
* Use the resulting data to reach the stronger normal / injective-by-blocking hypotheses needed by
  the normal-canonical-form lemmas and the `IsCanonicalForm` constructors.

## Removing zero blocks at positive lengths

The irreducible block decomposition may contain blocks whose matrices all vanish.  Such a block
contributes zero to every matrix product vector of positive length.  We therefore retain only the
nonzero blocks.  Their total bond dimension is bounded by the original bond dimension directly
from the dimension identity of the invariant-subspace decomposition; no empty-word comparison is
needed.
-/


-- @@ L265-350 verbatim
/-- **Nonzero irreducible block decomposition at positive lengths.**

Every MPS tensor is represented at every positive length by a direct sum of nonzero irreducible
blocks.  Each retained block has positive bond dimension, and the sum of their bond dimensions is
at most the original bond dimension.

This is the positive-length form of the recursive decomposition in Pérez-García, Verstraete,
Wolf, and Cirac, Theorem `Th:TIcanonical`, proof lines 771--826.  The source notes that zero blocks
may occur; they vanish identically on nonempty rings and are discarded here. -/
