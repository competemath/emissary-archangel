# Core `Std.Do` Enablement

This file is the *only* PolyFun root importing `Std.Tactic.Do`; every other use of
the core `Std.Do` weakest-precondition framework and the `mvcgen` tactic must go
through it (or through `PolyFun.PFunctor.Free.Do`), keeping the dependency on the
evolving upstream API quarantined.

It provides constructions — deliberately not instances — that transport core
`Std.Do` structure onto PolyFun's monads:

* `MonadHom.transportWP` / `MonadHom.transportWPMonad` pull a `WP`/`WPMonad`
  structure back along a monad morphism `F : m →ᵐ n`, so a monad that interprets
  into an `mvcgen`-ready stack inherits its predicate-transformer semantics.
* `MonadAttach.toWP` / `MonadAttach.toWPMonad` give any monad with exact support
  the demonic (almost-sure) interpretation at the `.pure` post shape: `wp x Q`
  holds when every possible output of `x` satisfies `Q`. `MonadAttach.toWPSound`
  proves that interpretation sound in core's sense, with `attach` supplying the
  `Ensures` witness.
* `MonadAttach.support_subset_of_wp` / `allOutputs_of_wp` go the other way: *any*
  `WPSound` predicate-transformer semantics bounds the support, so an
  `mvcgen`-discharged triple becomes a support fact in one step. These need only
  `LawfulMonadAttach`, so they also apply to `StateT`/`ReaderT`/`EStateM`, where
  `ExactMonadAttach` is unavailable.

Downstream libraries choose where to register these (scoped or local); a global
instance here would clash with registrations on reducible unfoldings of the same
monads downstream.

The demonic reading is the *only* one expressible here, and the reason is
structural. `Std.Do.PredTrans` carries conjunctivity as a structure field, stated
as a bi-entailment `t (Q₁ ∧ₚ Q₂) ⊣⊢ₛ t Q₁ ∧ t Q₂`. `AllOutputs` distributes over
`∧` in both directions, so `toWP` can discharge it; `SomeOutput` distributes only
left-to-right, since two different outputs may witness the two conjuncts
separately. There is therefore no angelic `Std.Do.WP`, and the angelic reading
stays at the `MAlgOrdered` level, whose `μ_bind_mono` asks only for monotonicity.
`PolyFunTest/Control/MonadAttach.lean` pins both directions and the failure.

This file depends on `Std.Do.Internal.Ensures` only through `WPSound`'s own field
type. Reasoning here goes through `WPSound.of_wp_canReturn`, which lives in the
stable `Std.Do` namespace; core's `Internal.MayReturn.canReturn_eq` (which proves
`CanReturn` *is* the intrinsic strongest postcondition) is cited but not depended
upon.

Both of those are on a known clock. Upstream of this pin, core promotes its
lattice-generic `Std.Internal.Do` tree to a public `Std.WP` (shipping in v4.35,
not v4.34), replaces `WPSound` with `Std.WP.LawfulWPMonadAttach` — whose single
field concludes from a `MonadAttach.CanReturn` witness directly, dropping the
`Ensures` formulation — and deprecates `mvcgen` in favour of `vcgen`. That stack
also drops conjunctivity from `PredTrans`, re-introducing it as the opt-in
`WPConjunctive`. Its one direction is exactly the direction angelic support fails;
an angelic bridge becomes possible because the class is optional and would
deliberately not be instantiated.
The elimination direction below is already stated against `CanReturn`, so it
carries over as a rename.
